## Our Vision

We believe the humanoid robotics market will evolve in a way similar to the smartphone market, with two dominant models emerging:

**Apple's Full-Stack Model:** A vertically integrated approach where a single company controls both hardware and software, delivering a seamless and highly optimized user experience.

**Android's Open Ecosystem:** A platform-driven model where an open-source operating system is adopted by multiple manufacturers, resulting in a diverse range of devices catering to different market segments and price points.

Due to economies of scale and the complexity of humanoid robotics, we anticipate a similar dual-model dynamic in this industry, with a few full-stack players and a broad open ecosystem driving innovation and widespread adoption.

## The Full-Stack Players

We expect Tesla to adopt a full-stack approach by controlling the entire value chain, from hardware and AI software to post-deployment services. Tesla's expertise in large-scale manufacturing, advanced battery technology, and autonomous systems positions it to create tightly integrated products with superior performance and reliability. With Tesla's 2024 annual production capacity exceeding 2 million vehicles and their extensive experience in scaling complex manufacturing operations, they are uniquely positioned to apply these capabilities to humanoid robotics. This approach would enable Tesla to dominate high-margin industrial and commercial markets, where customers are willing to pay a premium for comprehensive, well-integrated solutions.

Similar to Apple's position in the smartphone market, where they capture approximately 18% of global smartphone units but over 85% of industry profits, Tesla may capture a smaller share of total units sold but generate outsized profits by offering value-added services across the entire "problem space." These services could include software updates, predictive maintenance, and enhanced AI capabilities offered through subscription models. The ability to monetize both hardware and ongoing services would provide full-stack players with a significant competitive advantage in terms of profitability.

Tesla's approach to humanoid robots may mirror their strategy for electric vehicles. In the EV space, Tesla leverages real-world data from its vast fleet to refine its autonomous driving systems, with the ultimate goal of achieving full self-driving capability. As of 2024, Tesla's fleet has accumulated over 1 billion miles of Autopilot data, demonstrating the power of large-scale data collection. This process relies on human-driven data collection, which is then used to train models that eventually aim to eliminate the need for human input entirely.

Tesla's key insight lies in recognizing the immense value of gathering large volumes of high-quality, application-specific data. We believe this data-driven methodology is equally crucial for advancing humanoid robots. Access to vast, real-world datasets will be a critical differentiator in developing highly capable and autonomous humanoid systems.

## An Open and Fragmented Ecosystem

In contrast, we anticipate that the broader industry will coalesce around a shared, open-source ecosystem built on a **Humanoid Robotics Mind (HRM)**. This core would include a standardized operating system and a suite of essential components, such as a foundational world model. By providing a common framework, the HRM would enable a diverse range of manufacturers to design and deploy robots with varying features, capabilities, and price points, catering to a wide array of market demands.

An open ecosystem would enable faster innovation by encouraging collaboration across a large community of developers and hardware manufacturers. Over time, this model would create a vibrant and diverse market, with specialized robots optimized for specific sectors such as healthcare, logistics, personal assistance, hospitality, security, and defense. 

By allowing smaller manufacturers to focus on hardware without needing to develop a proprietary operating system, the open model would lower the barrier to entry and drive mass adoption. Similar to how Android allowed a broad range of handset makers to succeed, capturing over 70% of the global smartphone market across hundreds of device manufacturers, this approach would result in a wide variety of humanoid robots tailored for niche applications, ensuring broad use across industries and geographies.

Some industries, such as security and defense, are unlikely to accept dependence on a single full-stack provider like Tesla. The global military robotics market alone is expected to exceed \$30 billion by 2030. These sectors will demand dedicated, open-source, auditable systems developed by national providers under their control to ensure that critical functions remain sovereign and secure.

NVIDIA is working on open systems and is likely developing this HRM. It has introduced the concept of a "world foundation model" (WFM) with their Cosmos platform, for instance. These models are designed to understand the dynamics of the real world, including physics and spatial properties, enabling robots and autonomous vehicles to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in physical environments. NVIDIA's Omniverse platform already supports over 700 companies in simulation and digital twin development, providing a glimpse of the infrastructure that could underpin the HRM.

## The Open Ecosystem Architecture

The structure of this open ecosystem could follow a model similar to the hourglass-shaped protocol stack that forms the backbone of the TCP/IP architecture. This model is referred to as hourglass-shaped because it highlights the essential role of the IP layer as the narrow waist through which all communication flows.

At the top, a broad range of application-layer protocols (such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP) operate, while at the bottom, various network and link-layer protocols (such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and LTE) handle connectivity. The IP layer in the middle acts as a universal, minimal interface, ensuring seamless interoperability across diverse technologies and applications.

This hourglass structure has been key to the internet's scalability and success, enabling innovation and competition. It allowed a broad ecosystem of companies to flourish at the lower layers, such as Cisco, Juniper Networks, and other network hardware providers, while an even larger ecosystem developed at the upper layers, including major infrastructure and application providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, alongside millions of smaller developers and startups. By 2024, the internet ecosystem supported over 5.4 billion users and generated trillions of dollars in economic value annually.

Similarly, we believe that the open humanoid robot ecosystem will be structured around a narrow waist: a humanoid robotics mind, or HRM, composed of an operating system designed to work with a standardized "human body" form factor as the common denominator.

Below the HRM, we will likely find a few standardized "shared platforms", a similar concept to what we can see in the automotive industry with Volkswagen's MQB platform, Toyota's TNGA platform, or Hyundai-Kia's N3 platform. The MQB platform is used in models across multiple brands such as VW, Audi, Skoda, and SEAT, with over 100 vehicle models built on this single platform. Below those shared platforms are the individual humanoid robot models, which differ significantly, from very basic to highly advanced androids, to serve various use cases.

Above the HRM, we would have capabilities and plug-ins, and above this middleware, we would find the application layer targeting a wide range of use cases. Some robots may be conversational, while others may remain silent, depending on their intended function.

## Key Ecosystem Players

Like with Android, there will be many winners in an open ecosystem across several key areas:

**Core Operating System Developers:** Companies or projects working on the foundational HRM that can be adopted across the industry. The Robot Operating System (ROS), currently used by over 3,000 robotics companies and research institutions worldwide, represents an early example of this model.

**Specialized Hardware Providers:** Teams developing key components, such as advanced actuators, sensors, and lightweight materials, that will enable better humanoid robot performance. The actuator market for humanoid robots alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 35% through 2030, representing a multi-billion dollar opportunity.

**Niche Application Innovators:** Startups focusing on specific applications, such as elder care robots, industrial inspection robots, or autonomous delivery robots, which could dominate their respective markets. With the global elderly population expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, elder care robotics represents a particularly significant opportunity.

**Tooling and Simulation Platforms:** Developers creating tools that aid in robot design, testing, and deployment, such as simulation environments or low-code platforms for robot programming. The simulation software market for robotics is projected to exceed \$5 billion by 2028.

## The Timing

There is no doubt that humanoid robotics is a transformative technology that will happen. The real question is when will this become mainstream, when will it cross the chasm? Let's look at the two most recent personal hardware revolutions.

**The Personal Computer Revolution:** Personal computers began as niche tools for hobbyists. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, numerous brands with distinct ecosystems emerged, including 8-bit computers like the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum, followed by 16-bit systems such as the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. The market was fragmented, making it difficult to predict who would become the dominating players. The introduction of IBM's PC in 1981 with its open x86 computing architecture led to the proliferation of IBM PC compatible systems, with a number of hardware manufacturers competing to offer the best value for the price. The release of Windows 95 in 1995 further solidified the dominance of the open x86 architecture, with over 40 million copies sold in the first year alone, resulting in the current landscape dominated by Windows, macOS, and Linux (on the server side).

**The Mobile Phone Explosion:** The mobile phone market followed a similar trajectory. Initially, companies like Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola dominated, each offering devices with physical keyboards and proprietary operating systems. At its peak in 2007, Nokia commanded 49.4% of the global mobile phone market. Then, the Blackberry was a disrupting device in the space with the introduction of true email mobility, reaching 50 million users by 2010. Many thought that RIM would be the winner. The landscape shifted dramatically with the introduction of Apple's iPhone in 2007, featuring iOS, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system in 2008. In the years following the iPhone's debut, the smartphone market experienced exponential growth. By 2013, global smartphone shipments had surpassed 1 billion units annually, with Android and iOS devices accounting for the vast majority of these sales. By 2024, over 6.8 billion smartphones were in use globally. The market has been stable with those two ecosystems still dominating the market, with no disruptor in sight.

We can abstract this into four different phases:

**The Research Phase:** This is where the technology begins in labs and research institutions, often with limited commercial viability. For personal computers, this phase occurred during the 1960s and early 1970s, when computing was primarily a tool for large enterprises and universities. For mobile phones, this phase spanned from the 1970s through the early 1990s, with basic mobile communication devices being developed and tested.

**The Fragmentation/Explosion Phase:** This is the period when the technology enters the commercial market and numerous brands compete with different approaches and proprietary ecosystems. In personal computers, this phase was marked by the explosion of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with brands like Apple, Commodore, and Atari. For mobile phones, this was the era dominated by Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, and later BlackBerry, with each offering devices that were incompatible with one another. During this phase, it's difficult to predict which players will dominate long-term.

**The "Moment" Phase:** This is the turning point when a disruptor or a dominant standard emerges, transforming the market. For personal computers, this moment was the introduction of Windows 95, which established a unified software ecosystem around the x86 architecture. For mobile phones, this moment was the launch of the iPhone in 2007, which redefined the concept of a smartphone with its touch interface, app ecosystem, and seamless web browsing experience. The iPhone sold 1.4 million units in its first year, but by 2011, Apple was selling over 90 million iPhones annually. Within a few years, Android and iOS emerged as the two dominant platforms, and the market was reshaped.

**The Consolidation Phase:** In this phase, the industry stabilizes around only two or three dominant ecosystems or standards, with most of the early competitors either fading out or being acquired. In personal computers, the consolidation phase saw the dominance of Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS, while Linux found its niche in servers and enterprise environments, now powering over 96% of the world's top web servers. In mobile phones, the consolidation phase began around 2013, with Android and iOS accounting for nearly all smartphone sales. There is no longer "movement" at the core (the operating system) but there are still new entrants at the periphery (the hardware).

For humanoid robotics, we are currently in the research phase, where most advancements are taking place in labs and through pilot deployments. Some early commercial use cases have emerged, such as humanoid robots being deployed in BMW's production lines and Agility Robotics' units operating in warehouses. Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, while Figure AI raised \$675 million in early 2024 at a \$2.6 billion valuation, signaling strong investor confidence. However, the market remains nascent and highly fragmented, with no clear dominant players or platforms.

We foresee the industry entering the explosion phase in 2025, driven by a wave of investments from venture capital firms, established tech giants, and government-backed initiatives. In 2023 alone, humanoid robotics startups raised over \$1.5 billion in funding, a 500% increase from 2022. Substantial commitments from U.S. and Chinese companies are expected to accelerate progress, accompanied by a steady stream of breakthroughs and announcements. Similar to the AI boom in 2023 and 2024, where rapid advancements stunned the world, humanoid robotics could see a comparable pace of development, reshaping public perception and market expectations. The explosion phase usually generates massive returns for investors. For instance, even though Nokia and Blackberry didn't win the battle, their market cap grew massively during the explosion phase.

## Strategic Investment Areas

Based on this analysis, several areas appear strategically sound for the emerging ecosystem:

**Innovative hardware manufacturers:** Companies with a technological edge in humanoid robotics hardware. Examples include 1X, known for its advanced motion control systems, and Clone, which is developing human-like robots with muscle-based designs that could unlock entirely new use cases. Drawing a parallel with the mobile phone market, companies like Samsung and Sharp played pivotal roles by being key hardware suppliers during both the feature phone era and the smartphone revolution. Samsung's mobile division revenues grew from \$5 billion in 2000 to over \$200 billion by 2020. Similarly, foundational hardware players today could play critical roles as the humanoid robotics market matures.

**Decentralized training and deployment networks (DePIN):** Capturing data is a crucial step in building a foundational world model. Today, robotics and AI companies rely on a mix of real-world data collection and simulation. Large-scale decentralized networks could revolutionize this process by offering a more scalable and cost-effective way to gather real-world data. DePINs, such as Hivemapper, outperform traditional players like Google in real-time mapping by providing more up-to-date and accurate data, having already mapped over 15% of the world's roads through its decentralized network. A similar opportunity exists for humanoid robots, where decentralized networks could play a vital role in scaling adoption and driving continuous improvement through real-world data collection and feedback loops.

**AI models and solutions:** Companies and projects working on advanced AI technologies that will power the intelligence of humanoid robots present a compelling opportunity. These include real-time decision-making systems, sophisticated perception models, and autonomous behavior frameworks. The global AI in robotics market is projected to reach \$35 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 38%. A key advantage of these AI solutions is their platform-agnostic nature. They retain their value and applicability regardless of which "core" humanoid robot technology ultimately prevails, making them both resilient and high-impact investments.

**Open-source core development:** It is critical to support the development of an open-source core for humanoid robotics. Much like Android built on Linux to dominate the smartphone era, a widely adopted open-source robotics core could become the foundation of the future humanoid ecosystem. Projects such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), which offers a modular framework for robot development, could evolve into the standard for humanoid robotics. ROS 2, the latest iteration, has been adopted by major robotics companies including ABB, Bosch, and Samsung, demonstrating the viability of open-source approaches in industrial robotics.

## Looking Ahead

We are now entering an explosive phase in humanoid robotics, where exponential value creation is on the horizon. During the explosive growth phase of any emerging industry, significant upside exists even when selected investments don't turn out to be the long-term winners. Consider Nokia and Research In Motion (RIM), once dominant players in the mobile phone industry. While they are now seen as underdogs compared to Apple and Samsung, it's important to recall that in 1998, Nokia held a 27% global market share and had become the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer. Between 1994 and 1998, its stock price surged by 2,300%, driving its market capitalization to an impressive \$242.2 billion. Similarly, BlackBerry's market cap peaked at \$83 billion in 2008, despite the company's eventual decline.

The convergence of advanced AI, improved hardware, and decreasing costs suggests that the next decade will be transformative for humanoid robotics. Goldman Sachs estimates that humanoid robots could fill 48% to 126% of the U.S. labor gap and up to 53% of the elderly care gap globally by 2050. The addressable market could exceed \$150 billion annually within the next 15 years. There has never been a more exciting time to witness and participate in the future of robotics.
