</Note>

The DEUS supply is allocated across eight categories, as outlined in the chart and table below.

# Token supply distribution

- **Genesis Auction: 30%** Allocation for the community auction, enabling multi-token swaps during auction waves for DEUS and seeding the DAO’s treasury. Any unsold tokens from the auction will be reallocated to the DAO Treasury.
- **DAO Treasury: 30%** Tokens reserved for the DAO’s treasury, unlocking according to a predetermined schedule. This schedule may be adjusted through future governance decisions. Those tokens can only used via a DAO vote.
- **Liquidity & Adoption: 3.5%** Allocated for CEX listings, market-making, and marketing initiatives to drive early adoption and community growth.
- **Strategic Contributor Fundraise: 8%** Strategic contributors who participated in the pre-seed round to support the early development of the DAO and its infrastructure.
- **Advisors: 1%** Allocated to advisors who review funding proposals, develop investment theses, provide vote recommendations, and propose exit strategies before presenting projects for voting.
- **Core Contributors: 12.5%** XMAQUINA’s founding members and core developers who initiated the project and guided its transition into a DAO transferring ownership of the developed infrastructure and IP.
- **Foundation: 7.5%** Allocated to the DAO’s foundation to engage service providers involved in DAO operations, including implementing DAO initiatives, development, marketing, growth, and hiring.
- **DEUS Development Lab: 7.5%** The in-house innovation hub for developing robotics, ethical AI, and decentralized technologies. Open to DAO members, it transforms R&D into market ready products, enabling the DAO to create impactful ventures that may evolve into spin-outs. Those tokens can only used via a DAO vote.

# Token Utility

- **Governance Rights:** DEUS grants holders governance rights over the DAO’s treasury, allowing them to vote on key decisions, allocations, and overall strategy. This empowers participants to actively shape the DAO’s future direction.
- **Value Distribution Governance**: DEUS holders govern how value generated across the ecosystem is distributed. This includes outcomes from machine operations, SubDAO activity, and successful exits. Governance participants can propose and vote to direct this value toward token burns, staking programs, or treasury growth, ensuring that value created by the DAO is distributed transparently and in alignment with the community’s priorities.
- **Multi-Asset Treasury Exposure**: Gain exposure to the collective governance of a treasury filled with previously inaccessible opportunities, including equity in private robotics companies, strategic Physical AI assets and tokenized intellectual property.
- **Token Supply Governance:** The DAO may implement strategies to promote sustainable tokenomics and long-term value alignment, which may include supply adjustments, token buy backs, token sales, and other measures benefiting DEUS holders.
- **Incentives:** Active DAO members who complete bounties, contribute to DAO units, or support ecosystem growth can earn token rewards, encouraging long-term engagement and meaningful contributions.
- **DAO Initiatives**: The DAO may deploy tokens in DeFi to generate additional value and support growth. Governance can decide how this value is directed.
