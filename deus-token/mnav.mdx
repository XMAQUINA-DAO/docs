## The DEUS Market Cap and The Treasury NAV

While DEUS is anchored by a growing portfolio of real-world assets, its market value may also reflect the broader potential of the ecosystem. Governance rights, strategic reach, and access to emerging sectors like private robotics contribute to dynamics that extend beyond simple asset backing.

This pattern is not unique to crypto. In traditional markets, the value of a share often represents future potential, strategic positioning, and network strength in addition to the underlying assets.

## Case Study: MicroStrategy (Strategy Incorporated)

MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy Incorporated, provides a helpful comparison. As a publicly traded company holding large amounts of Bitcoin, its market capitalization has consistently exceeded the value of its BTC holdings. As of the latest data, its market cap-to-NAV (mNAV) multiple is approximately 2.7.

## Why Does This Premium Exist?

Some analysts argue that a company’s market cap should match the value of its holdings. However, this theory doesn’t hold up in practice. The premium has persisted, indicating other factors are at play.

### Premium Justification

Others point to MicroStrategy’s structure as a bridge for new types of participants such as bond traders and equity investors, who want exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding it. The company’s instruments, like convertible bonds, attract capital from sources that otherwise can’t interact with crypto markets directly.

This dynamic allows MicroStrategy to issue additional shares, acquire more Bitcoin, and scale its asset base, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel.

## Applying This to XMAQUINA

XMAQUINA is building a treasury composed of robotics equity, DePIN and DePAI networks, Machine RWAs, and tokenized intellectual property. Like MicroStrategy, it offers access to a category of assets—Physical AI—that are otherwise difficult or impossible for most participants to reach.

However, DEUS provides additional advantages beyond what traditional wrappers like MicroStrategy offer:

## Liquidity

DEUS is a tradable, permissionless digital asset which will be available 24/7 on global markets. In contrast, robotics equity, early-stage tokens, or physical machines are typically illiquid and require long holding periods. DEUS gives participants exposure to these assets while preserving flexibility and optionality.

## Global Investment Reach

Robotics innovation is accelerating rapidly in both United States and China, two of the world’s leading hubs for humanoid and industrial automation. Yet cross-border investment is heavily restricted. U.S. investors face barriers to accessing Chinese robotics ventures, and vice versa.

XMAQUINA DAO is not bound by these limitations. As a globally coordinated entity, it can allocate capital across regions, unlocking access to high-impact opportunities regardless of jurisdiction.

The DAO is also not limited to the U.S. and China. It can engage with robotics ecosystems in Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and beyond, building a diversified, borderless portfolio that traditional structures can't match.

## Democratized Access

Physical AI and robotics are capital-intensive sectors traditionally dominated by venture funds, corporate investors, and closed networks. Regulatory requirements, minimum check sizes, and geographic constraints often exclude individuals and smaller entities from participating.

DEUS removes these barriers by enabling anyone, anywhere, to gain exposure to this vertical. Through decentralized ownership, global participants can co-own and benefit from the value created by this emerging asset class and the rise of Physical AI.

If DEUS trades at a premium to NAV, such as a 2.5x multiple, the DAO can strategically allocate a portion of its DEUS holdings to acquire additional robotics equity, mission-aligned tokens or Machine assets. This enhances the asset base, reinforces long-term alignment, and creates a feedback loop between community participation, market value, and treasury strength.

## Disclaimer

This section is not financial advice and does not include price predictions. DEUS may trade at a premium, discount, or parity to the DAO’s NAV based on market sentiment, ecosystem performance, and external conditions. This is a conceptual framework for understanding potential dynamics, not a forecast.
