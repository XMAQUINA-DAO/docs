# Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions while using cryptocurrency to cover operational costs. Its chain grows continuously as verified blocks are added sequentially. Each block includes a cryptographic reference to the preceding block, a timestamp, and transaction details.

For example, nodes on the Bitcoin network use the blockchain to validate transactions and prevent issues like double-spending. This design ensures data integrity and trust without requiring a central authority.

# Decentralization

Decentralization shifts control and decision-making from a single authority to multiple participants. This structure reduces reliance on individual honesty or cooperation and prevents any single entity from wielding excessive influence. By design, it is more resistant to manipulation, enhancing robustness against attacks and external interference, while often improving service quality. However, dividing decision-making across multiple entities can slow transaction speeds, as there is no centralized authority for rapid approvals. Ultimately, the choice to adopt decentralization depends on whether its reliability and service advantages outweigh the potential inefficiencies.

# Genesis Auctions

The DEUS Genesis Auctions level the playing field, breaking away from the typical VC-dominated model and enabling everyone to participate on equal terms. Designed to distribute ownership of DEUS to the public while bootstrapping the DAO’s treasury, this fair auction builds a strong, engaged community and lays the foundation for decentralized governance from the start.

# Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems embodied in autonomous machines—such as robots or self-driving vehicles—that can perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI models that operate within digital confines, physical AI integrates spatial awareness and an understanding of real-world physics to interact seamlessly with its environment.

# Staking

Staking means locking up tokens for a certain period, signaling commitment to the DAO and its objectives. In the case of XMAQUINA, it is mandatory to stake DEUS tokens to acquire xDEUS voting tokens that are necessary to vote. To be a voting member of the XMAQUINA DAO, users need to stake.

Beyond voting, members benefit from DAO initiatives such as DeFi and staking programs. Staking demonstrates a deeper level of engagement: those who stake have something at stake, motivating them to act in the organization’s best interest.

# Voting

Once tokens are staked, participants can use their voting rights to influence the DAO’s decisions. This might include choosing which robotics and AI projects receive funding, setting rules for open collaboration, or shaping the development of the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

By allowing every staker to cast a vote, the system remains equitable and transparent. Proposals with the most support move forward, ensuring that decisions reflect the will of those who have demonstrated commitment.
