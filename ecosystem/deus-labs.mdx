DEUS Labs is XMAQUINA’s innovation hub at the intersection of Web3 and robotics. Its core mission is to develop products, services, properties, or spin‑offs that expand the utility of the DEUS token or strengthen the DAO through meaningful ownership stakes.

It explores opportunities in media and research to position XMAQUINA as a household name in Physical AI, while developing DePIN networks or open‑source products for humanoid and service robots. DEUS Labs works with research institutions, universities, and industry partners to move early‑stage concepts toward market‑ready products. Projects that reach MVP stage can be proposed for DAO funding, with outcomes designed to deliver lasting value to the ecosystem.
