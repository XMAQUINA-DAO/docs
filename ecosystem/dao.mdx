# The XMAQUINA DAO

The decentralized engine that governs a multi-asset treasury. It allocates capital to high-impact ventures in robotics, Physical AI, and decentralized infrastructure, ensuring strategic alignment and community-driven oversight.

DEUS holders govern how the DAO allocates ressources, machine operations and launchpad revenues. Through governance, the ressources can be directed towards new goals, ensuring that value created by the DAO is alignmed with the communityâ€™s priorities.

At the core of XMAQUINA, the DAO ensures value flows back to the network, not out of it.
