title: "RCM Protocol Overview"
---

The Robotics Capital Markets (RCM) Protocol is XMAQUINA’s infrastructure layer for allocation-specific robotics capital formation and structured onchain liquidity.

RCM expands the DAO’s capital coordination framework by introducing market infrastructure around individual robotics allocations held through dedicated Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).

It builds on XMAQUINA’s treasury model while introducing allocation-level capital formation and decentralized liquidity infrastructure.

## **Purpose**

Robotics is emerging as a significant global capital market, yet access remains structurally restricted and secondary liquidity fragmented.

XMAQUINA’s existing treasury model enables collective capital deployment into high-conviction robotics opportunities.

The RCM Protocol expands this framework by introducing:

• Asset-specific capital formation

• Structured onchain liquidity

• Market-based participation layers

• Protocol-level fee generation that accrues to the DAO treasury\
\
The RCM Protocol introduces a market infrastructure layer around robotics allocations, enabling continuous capital formation and structured liquidity across private robotics markets.

## **Core Design**

RCM is designed to:

• Facilitate capital formation around individual robotics allocations

• Hold acquired equity through dedicated SPVs

• Issue allocation-specific coordination tokens

• Enable decentralized exchange liquidity infrastructure

• Integrate DEUS as the base pairing asset within liquidity pools

• Establish protocol-level fee flows that accrue to the DAO treasury

## **RCM Lifecycle**

The RCM Protocol operates through Robotics SubDAO Auctions, which are structured onchain capital formation events centered on specific robotics allocations.

Each allocation progresses through a defined lifecycle:

### **1. Deal Sourcing**

XMAQUINA identifies and evaluates robotics allocation opportunities aligned with its mandate.

### **2. Robotics SubDAO Auction**

Capital is raised onchain for a specific allocation through a public auction mechanism.

If the minimum capital threshold is not reached, the allocation does not proceed.

### **3. SPV Formation**

Upon a successful raise, a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is established to hold the acquired equity position.

The SPV serves as the shareholder of record.

### **4. SubDAO Token Issuance**

An asset specific SubDAO Token is issued in connection with the SPV-anchored allocation.

The token enables governance over allocation-level matters and is structured for liquidity on decentralized exchanges.

### **5. Liquidity Deployment**

The SubDAO Token is paired against DEUS within a decentralized liquidity pool, establishing open market infrastructure around the allocation.

### **6. Ongoing Protocol Activity**

Secondary market activity generates protocol level fees that accrue to the DAO treasury.

## **SubDAO Tokens**

SubDAO Tokens are coordination tokens associated with individual robotics allocations held through dedicated SPVs.

Each token corresponds to a single allocation and operates within the broader RCM infrastructure.

SubDAO Tokens are:

• Asset specific

• Structured for liquidity on decentralized exchanges

• Anchored to SPV-held equity positions

• Designed to coordinate participation around a defined allocation

SubDAO Tokens enable governance over allocation-level matters. Their function is to facilitate coordination and liquidity around individual robotics allocations within the RCM framework.

## **Strategic Role Within XMAQUINA**

XMAQUINA’s core model centers on acquiring equity stakes in leading robotics companies through governance-directed capital deployment.

RCM extends this model by introducing allocation-specific capital formation and structured liquidity infrastructure around individual robotics positions.

In addition to supporting new allocations, the RCM framework may enable structured onchain liquidity mechanisms for existing treasury-held positions, subject to governance approval.

This expands the DAO’s capital coordination capabilities while preserving governance control over treasury strategy and capital allocation.

## **DEUS Integration**

The RCM Protocol integrates DEUS at the infrastructure level.

• All robotics SubDAO markets are paired against DEUS within DEX pools

• Protocol governance oversight is exercised by xDEUS holders

• Protocol-level fees accrue to the DAO treasury

By pairing SubDAO markets against DEUS and routing protocol-level fees to the DAO treasury, RCM positions DEUS at the center of ecosystem liquidity and governance.

## **Development Status**

The RCM Protocol is under active legal structuring and technical development.

Mechanisms, token structures, liquidity architecture, governance scope, and compliance frameworks may evolve prior to deployment.

Detailed technical documentation and finalized legal structures will be published as implementation progresses.
