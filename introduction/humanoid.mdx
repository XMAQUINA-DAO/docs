# The largest market opportunity of our time

Humanoid robotics is set to be the most disruptive technology since the internet. With robots moving into the physical world, the era of **Physical AI** is here.

2025 has already proven the scale of the opportunity: **Figure AI is valued at \$39.5B**, and **Apptronik recently hit \$6B**. The market is moving faster than anyone expected.

2026 will be a turning point, as AI breakthroughs, cheaper batteries, and scalable manufacturing push humanoids from pilots into large-scale deployment.

The top players remain private, with valuations accelerating. OpenAI, still private at **\$500B**, shows how long companies can grow before entering public markets.

**XMAQUINA exists to give its community early exposure to this generational opportunity**

# Why Humanoid Robots?

Pop culture often paints humanoid robots as a threat, from Terminator to Ex Machina. Yet despite these cautionary tales, the pursuit of human-like machines is accelerating. Why?

Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure, puts it simply:

> **_Our world has been built by humans, for humans_. Every tool, every environment, every machine is designed around the human form.**

A wheeled robot can’t climb stairs. A quadruped might handle stairs, but it can’t drive a car or ride a bicycle. To unlock true utility, robots must operate in the same world we do, a world designed for two legs, two hands, and one head.

Most objects are sized for the average adult human. Even humans outside those averages face challenges. That’s why humanoid robots of average height and build offer the greatest versatility.

The takeaway for investors is clear: **humanoids are the ultimate general-purpose platform**. Not just another niche tool, they are the entry point to every environment, every task, every industry. They won’t replace specialized machines , and they shouldn’t. Their role is to step in where humans can’t or won’t, filling the labor gaps that no other machine can address.

# The current landscape

Humanoid robotics is no longer science fiction. Progress is rapid:

- **Tesla Optimus**: walking, climbing, and recovering from falls
- **Figure 02**: now tested in BMW factories
- **Agility’s Digit**: deployed in logistics pilots
- **Apptronik Apollo**: backed by Google DeepMind, BMW
- **Unitree G1**: aggressively driving down costs in China

Other challengers; 1X Technologies, Agibot, Clone Robotics, Engineered Arts, are innovating fast. The field is entering an **explosive growth phase**.

# The future market

The economic and social impact will be massive.

- **Goldman Sachs** projects \$38B by 2035, but this is likely conservative.
- **ARK Invest** sees a \$24T opportunity.
- **Macquarie** projects \$209B by 2035, with 9.4M units shipped.

Humanoids will touch every major sector: industrial automation, healthcare, logistics, hospitality, and domestic assistance.\
Aging populations and labor shortages make adoption inevitable.

# The opportunity

We are entering the explosion phase of the humanoid robotics market.

Every major breakthrough in tech, PCs, smartphones, AI, created enormous value during their **explosion phase**. Even the companies that didn’t “win” generated outsized returns for early investors (Nokia’s market cap grew 2,300% between 1994–1998 before Apple took over).

Humanoid robotics is now entering the same phase. The leading companies are **private**, and valuations are rising before public access.

This is where XMAQUINA positions itself: investing early in private robotics companies and the wider ecosystem of technologies, infrastructure, and applications that will define the humanoid era.
