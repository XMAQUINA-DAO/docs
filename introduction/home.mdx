## Overview

**Humanoid robots are coming. XMAQUINA lets you own a piece of the future.**\
XMAQUINA is a community-driven ecosystem focused on humanoid robotics and Physical AI. By joining the XMAQUINA DAO, you gain exposure to the private companies building the machines of tomorrow.

## More than a DAO, an ecosystem

XMAQUINA is more than a DAO — it’s an ecosystem fueling the rise of humanoid robotics. The **DAO treasury** backs projects and experiments that grow long-term value for the community. The **DEUS Lab** drives open research and prototypes at the edge of robotics and AI. The **Launchpad** helps teams raise, launch, and scale inside the Machine Economy. And binding it all together is a committed **community** shaping strategy and sharing in the upside.

## More than a DAO, a movement

The XMAQUINA ecosystem brings together capital, community, and culture to accelerate the rise of humanoid robots and intelligent machines. Through the DEUS token, DAO members don’t just observe the robotic revolution, they own a piece of it.

# The XMAQUINA DAO

The decentralized engine that governs a multi-asset treasury. It allocates capital to high-impact ventures in robotics, Physical AI, and decentralized infrastructure, ensuring strategic alignment and community-driven oversight.

DEUS holders govern how the DAO allocates ressources, machine operations and launchpad revenues. Through governance, the ressources can be directed towards new goals, ensuring that value created by the DAO is alignmed with the community’s priorities.

At the core of XMAQUINA, the DAO ensures value flows back to the network, not out of it.

# The Machine Economy Launchpad

A DAO-owned protocol to tokenize and co-govern the next generation of Physical AI assets. The Launchpad enables builders to form SubDAOs to raise capital, and co-own robotics and machine-based assets. It provides access to XMAQUINA’s legal wrapper, governance framework, and technical infrastructure, lowering barriers to entry into the machine economy while preserving decentralized ownership and strategic alignment.

This is where robot-native startups meet on-chain coordination

The two core pillars of the XMAQUINA ecosystem are deeply interconnected. The DAO provides the governance, infrastructure, and in some cases capital to initiate and scale robotics-focused SubDAOs. In turn, the Launchpad drives ecosystem growth by enabling decentralized asset ownership and generating value for the DAO through protocol fees and a 5% token allocation from each SubDAO launched. Together, they form a self-reinforcing engine for accelerating the decentralized machine economy.

# The DEUS Token

The DEUS token is the coordination layer that powers the entire XMAQUINA ecosystem. It grants holders voting power over the DAO’s treasury and strategic direction, enabling collective ownership of Physical AI.

By staking DEUS, members participate directly in decisions around capital allocation, project funding, and the launch of new SubDAOs. This ensures that the ecosystem remains aligned with the community’s priorities while maintaining transparency and decentralization through on-chain governance.

Value generated from machine operations, launchpad and SubDAO activity, and successful exits flows back into the ecosystem. This creates a flywheel where those who stake, build, and govern are rewarded for their contributions as the machine economy grows.

# In Summary

XMAQUINA is building a new ecosystem and governance layer for Physical AI. Through its dual architecture, the XMAQUINA DAO and the Machine Economy Launchpad provide tools for global coordination, asset ownership, and decentralized capital formation.

DEUS is more than a token. It’s the connective tissue that aligns incentives across treasury growth, real-world robotics deployment, and ecosystem participation. xDEUS reinforces this alignment by filtering governance power toward those most committed to the mission.

For holders, DEUS offers exposure to a rapidly growing industry: humanoid robotics, autonomous systems, and decentralized infrastructure, while maintaining the flexibility, transparency, and liquidity of a crypto-native asset.

For builders and operators, XMAQUINA provides infrastructure to launch, govern, and scale machine-based systems with legal clarity and community support.

This is more than a DAO. It is a global effort to give people shared ownership in the robot economy.
