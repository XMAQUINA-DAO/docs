## Overview

Humanoid robots are coming. XMAQUINA lets you own a piece of the future.\
\
XMAQUINA is a community-driven ecosystem focused on humanoid robotics and Physical AI. By joining the XMAQUINA DAO, you gain exposure to the private companies building the machines of tomorrow.

## More Than a DAO, an Ecosystem

XMAQUINA is more than a DAO: it’s an ecosystem fueling the rise of humanoid robotics.

The **DAO treasury** backs projects and experiments that grow long-term value for the community. The **DEUS Lab** drives open research and prototypes at the edge of robotics and AI. The **Launchpad** helps teams raise, launch, and scale inside the Machine Economy. And binding it all together is a committed **community** shaping strategy and sharing in the upside.
