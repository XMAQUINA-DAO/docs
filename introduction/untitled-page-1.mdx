title: "Ecosystem Architecture"

XMAQUINA operates as an integrated humanoid capital coordination system composed of four core layers. Each layer serves a distinct role within the ecosystem.

Together, they enable capital deployment, liquidity formation, governance participation, and infrastructure expansion.

---

## **XMAQUINA DAO**

**Capital Allocation Layer**

The XMAQUINA DAO governs treasury deployment through structured, onchain governance.

Its responsibilities include:

- Deploying capital into private humanoid robotics companies
- Managing treasury structure and liquidity
- Approving ecosystem funding initiatives
- Coordinating long-term capital strategy

The DAO serves as the primary capital vehicle within the ecosystem.

## **Robotics Capital Markets (RCM) Protocol**

**Liquidity Layer**

The RCM Protocol introduces liquid, onchain markets for exposure to humanoid robotics positions.

Through asset-specific SubDAO structures:

- Capital is raised for targeted humanoid allocations
- Verified equity is held through structured legal entities
- SubDAO tokens are issued and paired onchain
- Secondary markets enable continuous trading and price discovery

This layer expands access beyond traditional private market constraints.

## **DEUS Token & Governance**

**Coordination Layer**

DEUS functions as the coordination and governance mechanism across the ecosystem.

It enables:

- Proposal submission and voting
- Treasury direction and capital allocation approval
- Staking mechanics (veModel)
- Alignment between capital deployment, liquidity, and incubation initiatives

Governance decisions are executed through transparent, structured processes.

## **DEUS Labs**

**Incubation & Ecosystem Expansion Layer**

DEUS Labs is the DAO’s in-house incubation hub developing ventures at the intersection of robotics and Web3.

Its mandate is to:

- Incubate products that expand the XMAQUINA ecosystem
- Integrate DEUS into new utility surfaces and distribution channels
- Increase visibility and market presence across the humanoid robotics sector
- Secure ownership stakes in ventures building within the humanoid robotics sector
- Create additional value pathways for the DAO beyond treasury allocations

DEUS Labs extends XMAQUINA beyond capital deployment by building and backing ventures that grow ecosystem reach, utility, and long-term positioning.
