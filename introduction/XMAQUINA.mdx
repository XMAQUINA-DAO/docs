Humanoid robotics is emerging as a new asset class. Access, however, remains largely confined to private funding rounds and institutional capital. Retail participants and on-chain capital have limited direct exposure to this sector.

XMAQUINA introduces structured, on-chain coordination to enable broader participation in humanoid robotics capital markets.

The ecosystem integrates:

- A DAO-governed treasury deploying capital into private humanoid robotics companies
- The Robotics Capital Markets (RCM) Protocol enabling liquid, on-chain secondary markets
- Governance infrastructure aligning capital allocation with token holders
- DEUS Labs, the DAO’s in-house incubation hub developing strategic ventures at the intersection of robotics and crypto

The objective is to build the infrastructure that enables broader participation in humanoid robotics capital markets.

The following sections outline each layer in detail.
