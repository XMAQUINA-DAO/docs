## The Timing

There is no doubt in our mind that humanoid robotics is a transformative technology that will happen. The real question is when will this become mainstream, i.e. when will this cross the chasm? Letʼs look at the two most recent personal hardware revolutions.

- **The Personal Computer Revolution**: Personal computers began as niche tools for hobbyists. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, numerous brands with distinct ecosystems emerged, including 8-bit computers like the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum, followed by 16-bit systems such as the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. The market was fragmented, making it difficult to predict who would become the dominating players. The introduction of IBM's PC in 1981 with its open x86 computing architecture, led to the proliferation of IBM PC compatible systems, with a number of hardware manufacturers computing to offer the best value for the price. The release of Windows 95 in 1995 further solidified the dominance of the open x86 architecture, resulting in the current landscape dominated by Windows, macOS, and Linux (on the server side).
- **The Mobile Phone Explosion**: The mobile phone market followed a similar trajectory. Initially, companies like Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola dominated each offering devices with physical keyboards and proprietary operating systems. Then, the Blackberry was a disrupting device in the space with the introduction of true email mobility. Many thought that RIM would be the winner. The landscape shifted dramatically with the introduction of Apple's iPhone in 2007, featuring iOS, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system in 2008. In the years following the iPhone's debut, the smartphone market experienced exponential growth. By 2013, global smartphone shipments had surpassed 1 billion units annually, with Android and iOS devices accounting for the vast majority of these sales. The market has been stable with those two ecosystems still dominating the market, with no disruptor in sight.

We can abstract this into four different phases:

1. **The Research Phase**: This is where the technology begins in labs and research institutions, often with limited commercial viability. For personal computers, this phase occurred during the 1960s and early 1970s, when computing was primarily a tool for large enterprises and universities. For mobile phones, this phase spanned from the 1970s through the early 1990s, with basic mobile communication devices being developed and tested. ‍
2. **The Explosion Phase**: This is the period when the technology enters the commercial market and numerous brands compete with different approaches and proprietary ecosystems. In personal computers, this phase was marked by the explosion of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with brands like Apple, Commodore, and Atari. For mobile phones, this was the era dominated by Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, and later BlackBerry, with each offering devices that were incompatible with one another. During this phase, it's difficult to predict which players will dominate long-term. ‍
3. **The "Moment" Phase**: This is the turning point when a disruptor or a dominant standard emerges, transforming the market. For personal computers, this moment was the introduction of Windows 95, which established a unified software ecosystem around the x86 architecture. For mobile phones, this moment was the launch of the iPhone in 2007, which redefined the concept of a smartphone with its touch interface, app ecosystem, and seamless web browsing experience. Within a few years, Android and iOS emerged as the two dominant platforms, and the market was reshaped. ‍
4. **The Consolidation Phase**: In this phase, the industry stabilizes around only two or three dominant ecosystems or standards, with most of the early competitors either fading out or being acquired. In personal computers, the consolidation phase saw the dominance of Microsoft Windows and Appleʼs macOS, while Linux found its niche in servers and enterprise environments. In mobile phones, the consolidation phase began around 2013, with Android and iOS accounting for nearly all smartphone sales. There is no longer “movementsˮ at the core (the operating system) but there are still new entrants at the periphery (the hardware).

The industry has entered the **explosion phase **in 2025, driven by a wave of investments from venture capital firms, established tech giants, and government-backed initiatives. Substantial commitments from U.S. and Chinese companies are expected to accelerate progress, accompanied by a steady stream of breakthroughs and announcements. Similar to the AI boom in 2023 and 2024, where rapid advancements stunned the world, humanoid robotics could see a comparable pace of development, reshaping public perception and market expectations. The explosion phase usually generates massive returns for investors. For instance, even though Nokia and Blackberry didnʼt win the battle, their market cap grew massively during the explosion phase.
