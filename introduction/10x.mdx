Crypto is often regarded as one of the fastest-adopted technologies in modern history, largely due to its decentralized nature, global accessibility, and the rapid growth of blockchain infrastructure. In just over a decade, it grew from a niche concept into a trillion-dollar industry, reshaping finance, technology, and culture. Its adoption was fuelled by a combination of speculative interest, technological innovation, and the promise of disrupting traditional systems.

However, one technology has outpaced even crypto in deployment speed: Large Language Models (LLMs). OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months, a milestone that took crypto years to achieve.

We project that the number of operational humanoid robots will grow from around 1,000 in 2025 to 10 million by 2029. Yes, you read that right. **Humanoid robots are on track for a 10x annual growth rate over the next six years,** mirroring semiconductor scaling laws. Besides Digital AI, there will be nothing growing at a faster rate.‍
