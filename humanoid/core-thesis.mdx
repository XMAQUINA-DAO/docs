XMAQUINA focuses exclusively on humanoid robots and the embodied AI ecosystem around them.

## **Core Thesis**

Humanoid robotics represents a hardware-anchored platform for artificial intelligence operating within environments built for humans.

Unlike specialized robotic systems designed for a single workflow, humanoids are structured around the human form. This enables them to interact with existing tools, infrastructure, and physical spaces without requiring systemic redesign.

As artificial intelligence systems mature, humanoids function as a general-purpose execution layer for AI in the physical world.

XMAQUINA concentrates exclusively on this domain.

## **Why Humanoids**

Human built infrastructure such as factories, warehouses, retail environments, vehicles, and domestic spaces is optimized for human scale and movement.

Robotic systems that replicate the human form can operate across these environments with minimal adaptation. This gives humanoids cross sector applicability not typically available to specialized automation systems.

This structural compatibility positions humanoids as a scalable physical AI layer rather than a niche robotics category.

## **Sector Scope**

XMAQUINA deploys capital exclusively within the humanoid robotics sector and its directly enabling infrastructure.

This includes:

- Humanoid platform manufacturers
- AI and autonomy systems purpose-built for embodied and physical operation
- Core hardware, actuation, sensing, and mobility technologies
- Deployment infrastructure and enabling software
- Data, simulation, and training systems supporting humanoid development
- Ecosystem intelligence and market infrastructure strengthening humanoid capital formation

Expansion beyond this scope requires explicit governance approval.

## **Strategic Orientation**

Humanoid robotics is a long cycle infrastructure build out.

XMAQUINA operates with a long-term orientation aligned with:

- Hardware development timelines
- Ecosystem standardization cycles
- Capital formation phases

Capital allocation prioritizes structural positioning within the humanoid robotics stack.

## **Capital Allocation Framework**

All allocations follow the DAO’s structured evaluation and governance framework, ensuring transparency, discipline, and alignment with the DAO mandate.
