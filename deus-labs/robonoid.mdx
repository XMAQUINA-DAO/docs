Robonoid is more than a website.\
It is the **cultural heartbeat** of the humanoid robotics revolution.

Born from **DEUS Labs**, Robonoid exists to tell the story of Physical AI—\
to capture the rise of humanoid robots, to shape the narrative of this new industrial age, and to make sure the world understands:\
**don’t fear the robots, own them.**

## Why Robonoid?

Every revolution needs its **chroniclers**.\
In the past, newspapers shaped nations.\
Today, Robonoid will shape the way humanity sees its new companions: robots.

We are building the **largest media outlet on Earth dedicated to humanoid robotics**.\
Not a niche blog. Not a tech column.\
\
A global stage where the progress of Figure, Agility, Apptronik, Unitree, Neura, and dozens more becomes part of a **shared cultural story**.

## The Mission

Robonoid exists to:

- **Inform**: Break the news, track the breakthroughs, and expose the setbacks.
- **Inspire**: Make robotics not just understood, but _felt_—through stories, images, and symbols.
- **Ignite**: Spark the imagination of millions, creating the cultural fuel that powers the Robolution.

This is not passive reporting.\
This is **narrative warfare**: the battle for how the world perceives humanoids, Physical AI, and the Machine Economy.

## Our Voice

Robonoid speaks with clarity, energy, and conviction.\
It is **not neutral**—it is aligned with the future we are building.\
Where others see fear, we see possibility.\
Where others hesitate, we push forward.\
Where others joke about robots taking jobs, we remind them:\
**ownership is the path to empowerment.**

## The Manifesto

- **Humanoids are coming.** Faster than the world expects.
- **Physical AI is inevitable.** Intelligence will walk, build, and live alongside us.
- **The story matters.** Whoever controls the narrative, controls the future.
- **Robonoid is that story.**

We will be the ones to tell it.\
We will archive it, spread it, and amplify it.\
We will turn scattered breakthroughs into a movement people can rally behind.
