## Overview

DEUS Labs is XMAQUINA's in-house innovation hub, bringing together technologists, researchers, and builders to collaborate, incubate, and develop at the intersection of Web3 and robotics.

The lab develops technologies and open-source frameworks for ethical robotics, focusing on high-risk, high-reward initiatives such as privacy-focused systems and DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).

## Token Allocation

**7.5% of DEUS tokens** are allocated to DEUS Labs to support research, development, and the incubation of breakthrough robotics projects.

## How It Works

DEUS Labs follows a structured innovation pipeline that transforms community ideas into market-ready products:

### 1. Ideation & Team Formation

DAO members submit proposals for decentralizing robotics automation. Interdisciplinary teams of experts and contributors form around the most promising ideas to turn them into actionable project proposals.

### 2. Research & Development

In collaboration with universities, research institutions, and industry partners, DEUS Labs conducts advanced research to validate concepts, explore solutions, and develop prototypes.

### 3. Community Feedback

Regular updates and discussions keep the community informed, enabling members to guide direction and ensure alignment with collective goals.

### 4. Selection & Spin-Offs

Successful projects submit proposals to the DAO to support further development. Approved initiatives may evolve into independent spin-offs, with the DAO retaining a significant stake to benefit from their success.

### 5. Product Development

Validated projects transition to full-scale development, delivering real-world products that advance the machine economy and create lasting value for the ecosystem.

## Focus Areas

DEUS Labs specializes in:

- **Ethical Robotics Frameworks** - Open-source standards for responsible AI and robotics development
- **Privacy-Focused Systems** - Decentralized architectures that protect user data and autonomy
