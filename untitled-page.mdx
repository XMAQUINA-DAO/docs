title: "RCM Protocol Overview"
---

The Robotics Capital Markets (RCM) Protocol is XMAQUINA’s capital coordination layer for robotics equity exposure.

It extends the DAO from a treasury allocator into market infrastructure, enabling structured capital formation and onchain liquidity around asset-specific robotics opportunities.

---

## **Purpose**

Robotics is emerging as a major capital market, yet access remains limited by structural barriers and fragmented liquidity.

XMAQUINA’s existing treasury model enables collective capital deployment into high-conviction robotics opportunities.

The RCM Protocol expands this framework by introducing:

• Asset-specific capital formation

• Structured onchain liquidity

• Market-based participation layers

• Protocol-level fee generation that accrues to the DAO treasury\
\
The RCM Protocol introduces a market infrastructure layer around robotics allocations, enabling continuous capital formation and structured liquidity across private robotics markets.

## **RCM Lifecycle**

The RCM Protocol operates through Robotics SubDAO Auctions, which are structured onchain capital formation events centered on specific robotics allocations.

Each allocation progresses through a defined lifecycle:

### **1. Deal Sourcing**

XMAQUINA identifies and evaluates robotics allocation opportunities aligned with its mandate.

### **2. Robotics SubDAO Auction**

Capital is raised onchain for a specific allocation through a public auction mechanism.

If the minimum capital threshold is not reached, the allocation does not proceed.

### **3. SPV Formation**

Upon a successful raise, a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is established to hold the acquired equity position.

The SPV serves as the shareholder of record.

### **4. SubDAO Token Issuance**

An asset specific SubDAO Token is issued in connection with the SPV-anchored allocation.

The token enables governance over allocation-level matters and is structured for liquidity on decentralized exchanges.

### **5. Liquidity Deployment**

The SubDAO Token is paired against DEUS within a decentralized liquidity pool, establishing open market infrastructure around the allocation.

### **6. Ongoing Protocol Activity**

Secondary market activity generates protocol level fees that accrue to the DAO treasury.

## **SubDAO Tokens**

SubDAO Tokens are coordination tokens associated with individual robotics allocations held through dedicated SPVs.

Each token corresponds to a single allocation and operates within the broader RCM infrastructure.

SubDAO Tokens are:

• Asset specific

• Structured for liquidity on decentralized exchanges

• Anchored to SPV-held equity positions

• Designed to coordinate participation around a defined allocation

SubDAO Tokens enable governance over allocation-level matters.

Their function is to facilitate coordination and liquidity around individual robotics allocations within the RCM framework.

## **DEUS Integration**

The RCM Protocol structurally integrates DEUS at multiple layers:

• All SubDAO markets are paired against DEUS

• Governance oversight is exercised by xDEUS holders

• Protocol fees accrue to the DAO treasury

Each additional SubDAO market expands protocol-level activity centered around DEUS liquidity.

All treasury allocations remain subject to governance approval.

## **Strategic Role Within XMAQUINA**

Prior to RCM, XMAQUINA operated primarily through periodic treasury deployments.

RCM introduces:

• Continuous capital formation

• Asset-specific coordination

• Ongoing market-based protocol activity

• Expanded governance scope

This shifts the DAO from episodic allocation toward infrastructure-driven ecosystem expansion.

## **Development Status**

The RCM Protocol is under active legal review and technical buildout.

Mechanisms, token structures, liquidity models, and compliance frameworks may evolve before launch.

Any deployment will occur through formal governance approval.

---

## **Legal Notice**

SubDAO Tokens do not represent equity, ownership, or legal claims in any underlying company or SPV.

They confer no rights to dividends, redemption, or company-level governance.

Participation may be subject to jurisdictional restrictions.

All structures described are subject to change based on ongoing legal, technical, and governance review.
