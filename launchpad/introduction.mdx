## Overview

The Machine Economy Launchpad is XMAQUINA's infrastructure for launching new projects at the intersection of robotics, Physical AI, and Web3. It provides a framework for builders to create SubDAOs, raise capital from the community, and bring autonomous machine projects to life.

By leveraging XMAQUINA's legal framework, infrastructure, and engaged community, the Launchpad dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs building in the machine economy.
