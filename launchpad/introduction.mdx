## Overview

The Machine Economy Launchpad is XMAQUINA's infrastructure for launching new projects at the intersection of robotics, Physical AI, and Web3. It provides a framework for builders to create SubDAOs, raise capital from the community, and bring autonomous machine projects to life.

By leveraging XMAQUINA's legal framework, infrastructure, and engaged community, the Launchpad dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs building in the machine economy.

### **Examples of Launchpad Use Cases**

**Private Market Access SubDAO** A community could launch a SubDAO to coordinate and secure a structured allocation in Engine AI, a robotics company based in China. Through the Launchpad, contributors seeking exposure to the company pool resources into the SubDAO, which collectively manages the participation process. Members receive tokens representing their share in the SubDAO, granting coordinated governance rights over the position. This model enables collective access to high-barrier opportunities and facilitates transparent, on-chain governance of the underlying exposure.

**Machine RWA SubDAO** Let’s start with an example featuring one of our partners: iFarm. iFarm provides full-stack technology for automated vertical farming, offering everything from white-labeled infrastructure and proprietary software to farming products and operational management. Their innovative subscription model includes finding and training a local farm manager, allowing the entire farming operation to be managed efficiently with minimal friction.

Using the XMAQUINA Launchpad, a community could form a SubDAO to fund and co-own a vertical strawberry farm powered by iFarm in a region like the UAE, where demand for locally grown, premium produce is rising. Global interest in this space is accelerating, with major players like Plenty and Alpha Dhabi committing over \$680 million to vertical farming projects in the region [[source](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/us-startup-plenty-alpha-dhabi-plan-us680-million-vertical-farms)]. The SubDAO would hold the underlying machine asset and receive the revenue generated from produce sales. Token holders could govern operational decisions, reinvest profits, or distribute to members, all through transparent on-chain governance.  This model lowers the barrier to entering capital-intensive industries and makes high-performing machine assets accessible to a broader community. It can be extended to other Machine RWAs such as autonomous mobility fleets, drone farming systems, and even one day fleets of humanoid robots, enabling real-world income streams to be coordinated, owned, and governed collectively.

**Key features include:**

**• SubDAO Formation:** Projects can launch dedicated SubDAOs with custom governance rules, operating logic, and clearly defined goals based on their asset or mission focus.

•**Capital Coordination: ** The Launchpad enables on-chain fundraising, modeled after the Genesis Auction, allowing communities to transparently pool resources to support robotics deployments and asset acquisition.

**• Asset Ownership and Tokenization: **SubDAOs can hold and manage Physical AI assets, such as deployed robots or equity exposure, and may issue their own tokens representing ownership, access, or revenue participation.

•**Integration with Core Infrastructure: ** While independent, SubDAOs can access shared XMAQUINA resources including legal templates, development tooling, DeFi infrastructure, and can submit funding proposals to the main DAO.

### **Launchpad Fees and Allocation Strategy**

Each SubDAO launched through the Machine Economy Launchpad contributes value back to the XMAQUINA DAO through a structured fee model. These fees are designed to strengthen the DAO’s treasury and support its long-term strategy of accumulating mission-aligned assets.

**Fee breakdown:**

**• 5% of SubDAO Tokens Issued: **Allocated to the XMAQUINA DAO treasury.

**• 5% of Capital Raised During SubDAO Auctions:** Collected as a service fee and directed to the treasury.

All fees flow directly to the DAO, reinforcing its ability to continue acquiring strategic assets. This structure ensures that each SubDAO launch strengthens both its own mission and the shared foundation of the broader XMAQUINA ecosystem.

The deployment of the Launchpad is expected to bring new capital into the ecosystem, driving growth and accelerating innovation. This milestone will attract a diverse range of participants including developers, researchers, operators, and end-users, helping to build a vibrant community around decentralized robotics.
