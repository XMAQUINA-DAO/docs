# Crypto x Robotics Projects

There are **three packages** of support for Crypto x Robotics projects

## 1. Entry package: exposure to the crypto x robotics ecosystem

**Commitment from the project**

- Contribution of between **1 and 2% of token supply** to the XMAQUINA community. This should take the form of a portion as airdrop to the DEUS Token holders and an allocation to the DAO treasury.
- **Tokens allocated to the DAO treasury are locked for 12 months post-TGE**, ensuring no sell pressure during the critical early phase of the project.
- **Tokens airdroped to the XMAQUINA community members should be free to move** as soon as the project's token is transferrable.

**What you receive publicly**

- Presence in the DAO treasury portfolio
- Dedicated project page curated by the execution team

### Fundraising mechanics

When a project is launched via the Machine Launchpad:

- Investors contribute **USDC** and receive project tokens in return

**Allocation of project tokens**

- **95%** → launchpad investors
- **5%** → DAO treasury

**Allocation of USDC**

- **92%** → project treasury
- **8%** → NC wallet (operations & execution costs)

This structure aligns incentives:

- the DAO gains treasury depth
- investors gain early access
- projects receive the majority of capital raised to execute their roadmap
