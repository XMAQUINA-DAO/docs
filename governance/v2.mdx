Governance V2 marks a major upgrade in how the DAO makes decisions, rewards members, and moves at the speed of opportunity. 

Effective governance is central to the DAO’s mission. The governance process integrates both off-chain and on-chain mechanisms, enabling token holders, and community members to shape the DAO’s direction transparently and adaptively. By leveraging proven frameworks such as Aragon, LayerZero and adopting a veToken-based voting model inspired by Curve, the DAO achieves a balance of efficiency and accountability.

## Key points:
- **xDEUS is the governance token:** DEUS holders must stake their tokens to mint xDEUS, the XMAQUINA ecosystem’s veToken. xDEUS grants governance rights and unlocks access to protocol rewards. xDEUS is a soulbound veToken ERC721 token. 
- **Rewards Grow Over Time:** The longer DEUS remains staked, the higher the reward multipliers. This increasing both their influence and earning potential.
- **Optimistic, Dual Governance:** Governance V2 introduces an agility layer within governance through OPX proposals. This fast-track mechanism allows trusted DAO units like the Northstar Council to propose time-sensitive actions. Each OPX proposal includes a time-lock period, giving xDEUS holders the ability to veto. The result is a system that balances speed with decentralization and accountability.
- **Easy to understand:** Our DAO portal makes governing the future of robotics easy and is powered by the full Aragon stack. Use it at: https://dao.xmaquina.io/stake

With xDEUS at the center, Governance V2 opens up a new era of participation, long-term alignment, and protocol rewards for members.

## Governance in more detail

Proposals are brought to a vote through one of two venues, depending on the nature of the decision:

1. **Snapshot Governance**: Handles operational decisions that do not involve on-chain transactions, such as gauging community sentiment or making non-binding resolutions.
2. **Aragon Governance**: Manages on-chain proposals, including updates to governance parameters or treasury operations (e.g., capital deployment or profit distribution from exits).

Each proposal is routed to the appropriate venue — not both. All ideas begin with open discussions in the community (e.g., the official Discord), where members can brainstorm, refine concepts, and outline next steps. This forum is accessible to everyone, regardless of DEUS token ownership.

### Proposal Lifecycle

#### Phase 1: Ideation & Proposal Formation
Ideas emerge organically within the XMaquina community through informal discussions on the official Discord or other forums. Community members surface opportunities, flag issues, and propose directions. Participation is open to all.

Once an idea gains traction, the Northstar Council takes the lead in shaping it into a formal proposal. The council collects the necessary information from community discussions, scores input from both the community and broader industry context, and conducts any required due diligence. For proposals involving significant treasury movements (e.g., investments), this includes strategic assessment, financial implications, exit strategies, and risk analysis. The result is a well-structured proposal ready for a vote.

#### Phase 2: Voting
The proposal is brought to a vote through the appropriate venue:

- **Snapshot**: For operational decisions, sentiment checks, and non-binding resolutions. Voting is off-chain and gas-free.
- **Aragon**: For on-chain proposals involving treasury operations, parameter changes, or protocol upgrades. Voting is on-chain and enforced by smart contracts.

To participate in on-chain votes, DEUS tokens must be locked to mint xDEUS, a non-transferable ERC721 token that decentralizes governance power.

##### On-Chain Governance Types

For proposals routed through Aragon, one of the following governance processes applies:

1. **OPX - Optimistic Dual Governance**: Proposals are initiated by the Northstar Council and can be vetoed by any xDEUS holder. This enables quick actions with community oversight.
2. **XMQ - Community Dual Governance**: A community-led proposal under the DAO's optimistic governance system. Any member(s) holding the required minimum of the total token supply can initiate proposals. Provided that the rest of the community do not veto, the proposal is automatically approved. XMQ promotes grassroots initiatives.
3. **BOT - Dual Governance**: Proposals originate from the Northstar Council, with xDEUS holders voting yes or no. Approval requires sufficient quorum.

An optimistic dual governance plugin from Aragon OSx allows Northstar Council delegates to propose actions, with token holders retaining veto rights. This supports rapid development while transitioning to full decentralization. Community members can also submit proposals directly without needing council approval.

#### Phase 3: Execution & Retrospective
Approved on-chain proposals execute automatically via Aragon, which may involve:
- Treasury allocations
- Project funding
- Parameter adjustments
- New asset launches
- Ecosystem infrastructure development

Following execution, results are discussed with the community. The Northstar Council and community review outcomes together, assess impact, and form plans to carry out the will of the token holders. This retrospective loop ensures accountability and continuous improvement in the governance process.

## Governance Epochs and Scheduling
Governance updates occur weekly every Thursday, aligned with epochs (see veToken docs for details). Votes typically last one epoch (approximately 5 days). A sample cycle might include:
- Early week: Community discussions and ideation (e.g., Discord)
- Mid-week: Proposal formation by Northstar Council
- Epoch-aligned: Voting (Snapshot or Aragon) and execution

Minor decisions without fund transfers may use Snapshot alone for off-chain implementation.

### Quorum and Participation
Quorum is a percentage of circulating xDEUS that must participate for a proposal to be valid. Unlike traditional ERC20 token voting systems that offer For/Against/Abstain options, the veToken governance model operates differently depending on the governance type. For optimistic proposals (OPX, XMQ), governance is veto-based — proposals pass unless actively vetoed by xDEUS holders during the time-lock period. For BOT proposals, xDEUS holders vote yes or no, and the proposal must meet a minimum participation threshold to pass. Parameters like quorum thresholds and vote durations can evolve as the DAO matures.

### Staking Parameters
- **Minimum Stake**: xDEUS holders must maintain their stake for at least 5 days before initiating a withdrawal request.
- **Cooldown Period**: After requesting withdrawal, a 5-day cooldown applies before DEUS tokens become accessible.
