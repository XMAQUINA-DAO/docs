When the token generation event (TGE) arrives, so does Governance V2. It will mark a major upgrade in how the DAO makes decisions, rewards members, and moves at the speed of opportunity.

- **xDEUS is Coming:** DEUS holders will stake their tokens to mint xDEUS, the XMAQUINA ecosystemâ€™s veToken. xDEUS grants governance rights and unlocks access to protocol rewards.
- **Power Grows Over Time:** The longer DEUS remains staked, the higher the voting power and reward multipliers a member unlocks, increasing both their influence and earning potential.
- **Introducing Optimistic Dual Governance:** Governance V2 introduces an agility layer within governance through OPX proposals. This fast-track mechanism allows trusted DAO units like the Northstar Council to execute time-sensitive actions. Each OPX proposal includes a time-lock period, giving xDEUS holders the ability to veto. The result is a system that balances speed with decentralization and accountability.

With xDEUS at the center, Governance V2 opens up a new era of participation, long-term alignment, and protocol rewards for members. Full details on the vote escrowed model, staking mechanics, and governance flows will be released ahead of launch.
