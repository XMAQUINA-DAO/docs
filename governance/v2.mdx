description: "Post-TGE veToken governance on the Aragon DAO stack"
---

Governance V2 marks a major upgrade in how the DAO makes decisions, rewards members, and moves at the speed of opportunity. 

Effective governance is central to the DAO’s mission. The governance process integrates both off-chain and on-chain mechanisms, enabling token holders, and community members to shape the DAO’s direction transparently and adaptively. By leveraging proven frameworks such as Aragon, LayerZero and adopting a veToken-based voting model inspired by Curve, the DAO achieves a balance of efficiency and accountability.

## Key points:
- **xDEUS is the governance token:** DEUS holders must stake their tokens to mint xDEUS, the XMAQUINA ecosystem’s veToken. xDEUS grants governance rights and unlocks access to protocol rewards. xDEUS is a soulbound veToken ERC721 token. 
- **Rewards Grow Over Time:** The longer DEUS remains staked, the higher the reward multipliers. This increasing both their influence and earning potential.
- **Optimistic, Dual Governance:** Governance V2 introduces an agility layer within governance through OPX proposals. This fast-track mechanism allows trusted DAO units like the Northstar Council to propose time-sensitive actions. Each OPX proposal includes a time-lock period, giving xDEUS holders the ability to veto. The result is a system that balances speed with decentralization and accountability.

With xDEUS at the center, Governance V2 opens up a new era of participation, long-term alignment, and protocol rewards for members.
