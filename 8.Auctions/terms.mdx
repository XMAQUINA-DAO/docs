These T&C govern your participation in the Genesis Auction. Please read them carefully as they affect your obligations and legal rights. By applying for or participating in the Genesis Auction, connecting your Wallet to the Genesis Auction Page, or by clicking the button “I accept” or respective check box referencing these T&C, you acknowledge that you have read, accept without modifications, and agree to be bound by these T&C and all terms incorporated herein by reference, which form a legally binding agreement between you and us. If you do not agree to these T&C, you shall not apply for or take part in the Genesis Auction, and you must immediately discontinue your participation therein. If acting on behalf of an entity, you confirm that you are authorised to accept these T&C on its behalf and bind that entity.

## 2.  Eligibility

To be eligible to participate in the Genesis Auction, you must: (i) be capable of forming a legally binding agreement with us; (ii) not be a Prohibited Person nor participate in the Genesis Auction for their benefit; (iii) be at least 18 years old or of legal age in your jurisdiction; (iv) if acting on behalf of an entity, be authorised by the entity and confirm that it is properly existing and in good standing, and (v) comply with these T&C. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not participate or immediately suspend your participation in the Genesis Auction until you do.

## 3. Genesis Auction

### _a_. Token Genesis

Subject to these T&C, by participating in the Genesis Auction you may purchase a certain number of Tokens, if and as may be made available to you. The Token parameters, features and other information regarding the Tokens may be further outlined in the Materials, provided, however, that the Materials are provided for information purposes only, are subject to change without further notice or liability, and do not form a part of these T&C.

### b. Our Rights

We reserve the right at any time, acting at our sole and absolute discretion, to (i) limit the number of Tokens available for sale, and establish a minimum or maximum number of Tokens that can be purchased by one Genesis Auction participant; (ii) limit the number of the Genesis Auction participants; (iii) establish and introduce certain Participation Requirements and other restrictions in relation to the Genesis Auction, including indicating specific Virtual Assets that can be used to purchase the Tokens; (iv) sell the Tokens by any means, other than through the Genesis Auction Page, including through other venues and platforms, and on different terms including more favourable ones; (v) sell Tokens during specific time periods (waves) with Wave Terms varying from one another (potentially becoming less favourable), modify the number of waves by increasing or decreasing their number or parameters, or cancel any wave; or (vi) otherwise change the parameters and terms of the Genesis Auction at any time without notice and any liability whatsoever.

### c. Participation Requirements

To participate in the Genesis Auction, you may be required to fulfil all applicable Participation Requirements within the specified timeframe, if any. We will determine, at our sole discretion, whether these Participation Requirements have been completed correctly and on time. Our decision will be final and cannot be disputed by you. If you fail to meet the Participation Requirements to our satisfaction, you may not be allowed to participate in the Genesis Auction or your participation may be cancelled.

### d. Purchase of Tokens

The Genesis Auction may be conducted in multiple waves, each with its own Wave Terms. Wave Terms, including pricing, lock-up and unlock schedules, may vary between waves. The Genesis Auction or any specific wave may have a limited duration. If you do not complete your purchase and all applicable conditions within that timeframe, your right to buy Tokens will automatically expire and terminate. To purchase Tokens, you must transfer the respective amount in the designated Virtual Assets during the applicable period, as instructed on the Genesis Auction Page. Only the designated Virtual Assets may be used for payment; any unapproved Virtual Assets sent by you will be disregarded by us, forfeited and permanently lost, in which case we shall not be responsible for their loss or recovery, or any losses and damages sustained. Certain time periods indicated on the Genesis Auction Page or otherwise communicated by us may depend on events within the underlying blockchain network, such as block additions or block height; in such cases, the specified times and dates are provided for informational purposes only, and the actual timeline shall be determined by the relevant blockchain events. The actual timeframes may be determined and enforced by the applicable Smart-Contracts or by us manually.

### e. Restrictions Applicable to Tokens

The Tokens purchased during the Genesis Auction may be subject to Restriction Terms outlined on the Genesis Auction Page, through applicable Smart-Contracts, or otherwise provided before, during, or after the Genesis Auction. Restriction Terms may differ between participants based on the wave in which the purchase occurs. We may set or change these Restriction Terms at our sole discretion, at any time, without notice or your approval, and without any liability, provided that such changes apply equally to all participants of the relevant wave. These Restriction Terms may differ between categories of purchasers and could include conditions such as lock-up and unlock restrictions, gradual token release over time or in particular instalments. The Restriction Terms are a key part of your Genesis Auction participation and may be programmed into applicable Smart-Contracts or relevant software. Ensure you fully understand all applicable Restriction Terms before participating in the Genesis Auction. The Wave Terms applicable to your wave, as well as the respective Restriction Terms, may be less favorable compared to other waves. You may choose the wave in which you participate while taking such restrictions and other applicable terms into consideration. We reserve the right to set, modify, or update Wave Terms at our sole discretion, at any time, without notice or approval, and without any liability.

### f. Token Distribution

Depending on the applicable Restriction Terms, all or part of the Tokens will not be available to you immediately after the purchase. After sending the purchase amount through the Genesis Auction Page or other permitted means, if and as applicable, your Wallet will be assigned a Claim Token (or relevant number of Claim Tokens, if and as the case may be). The distribution of Tokens can be facilitated through relevant Smart-Contracts, which you hereby accept. To receive the purchased Tokens, you may be required to manually claim them from the respective distribution Smart-Contracts with a Wallet that is assigned to the Claim Token. The Tokens will be delivered to the distribution Smart-Contracts and will become available for claim as per the applicable Restriction Terms and Wave Terms, based on the wave during which the Tokens were purchased. It is your responsibility to monitor announcements related to the distribution of the Tokens, including in the Communication Channels, and to claim the Tokens according to the applicable Restriction Terms and Wave Terms, and within the applicable timeframes. The Claim Token is non-transferrable, therefore you shall be required to use the same Wallet that contains the Claim Token to claim and receive the Tokens. The claiming period may be limited in duration, and if you fail to claim the Tokens within the relevant period, the unclaimed Tokens shall be forfeited and lost; provided, however, that we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, decide to manually deliver the Tokens to your relevant Wallet or a configured Smart-Contract permitting further claim and distribution, although we are under no obligation to do so. All and any of our obligations relating to the purchased Tokens or their distribution to you shall end with the Closing. We shall not be responsible for any failure or inability on your part to claim or withdraw the purchased Tokens from a properly configured Smart-Contract.

### g. Ownership and Refunds

When you transfer Virtual Assets to the applicable Smart-Contract in connection with your participation in the Genesis Auction, you relinquish ownership of the transferred Virtual Assets. You shall be deemed the owner of the Tokens only once and if you received them to your Wallet in accordance with the terms hereof. Your rights to participate in the Genesis Auction and purchase the Tokens shall be personal and non-transferable, and shall always be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. To the maximum extent permitted under the law, any purchase of the Tokens in the Genesis Auction shall be final and non-refundable. All our obligations concerning the Genesis Auction and sale of the Tokens to you shall be considered fulfilled and fully performed upon the Closing.

### h. Compliance Checks

To participate in the Genesis Auction, you may be required to complete Compliance Checks, which we can require at any stage — before, during the Genesis Auction, or before the distribution of the purchased Tokens (whether to the Smart-Contract or directly to you). The Compliance Checks must be completed within a timeframe specified by us. Access to the Genesis Auction or purchased Tokens may be suspended or withheld until the Compliance Checks are successfully completed. We are not responsible for your inability to access, claim, or receive purchased Tokens if you fail to complete the Compliance Checks or meet the applicable requirements. If you fail to successfully pass the Compliance Checks, we may refuse to distribute the Tokens. In such a case, unless otherwise prescribed by the applicable law, we may refund the payment you made to the same Wallet from which it was sent or such other address, if and as may be agreed with us. We are not responsible for any delays, losses, or technical issues arising from such a refund process. Compliance Checks may be conducted by a Third-Party Service provider acting on our behalf, which is hereby accepted by you. You must provide accurate, complete, and true information during or in connection with the Compliance Checks. The decision on whether you have passed the Compliance Checks will be made solely at our discretion, is final and cannot be disputed by you.

## 4. Wallet

### a. General

In order to participate in the Genesis Auction, you shall connect your Wallet through one of the compatible third-party software wallets. The Wallets and any software wallet solutions constitute Third-Party Services, and we are not responsible for, do not endorse, and cannot be held liable or responsible in connection therewith. We do not make any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the Wallets and software wallet solutions used by you in connection with the Genesis Auction. When using Wallets and software wallet solutions, you should review applicable terms and policies that govern your use thereof.

### b. Security

Neither we nor the applicable Smart-Contract receive access to or control over your Wallets or Virtual Assets held in such Wallets. You are solely responsible for securing your Virtual Assets, Wallets, and Wallet Credentials. You should not disclose your Wallet Credentials to any third person nor allow any third person to access your Wallet. You will be solely responsible for any use of your Wallet, and Wallet Credentials, as well as their confidentiality. You remain responsible for all transactions carried out via your Wallet or using the Wallet Credentials.

## 5. Smart-Contracts

### a. General

The Genesis Auction operates through certain Smart-Contracts. Although the Genesis Auction Page provides an interface to interact with the Smart-Contracts, the Genesis Auction Page is distinct from the Smart-Contracts which constitute independent software. Further details about the Smart-Contracts may be outlined in the Materials, provided, however, that the Materials are provided for information purposes only and do not form a part of these T&C. Access to, use of, and any other interaction with the Smart-Contracts shall be subject to such rules, limitations and restrictions as implemented in the respective Smart-Contracts. In the event of any discrepancies between the terms set forth herein and those programmed into the applicable Smart-Contracts, the terms of the Smart-Contracts shall govern and prevail for transactions conducted on the blockchain, and the terms set forth herein shall govern and control in all other circumstances.

### b. Disclaimer

The Smart-Contracts are deployed on public blockchain networks that operate in a decentralised and autonomous manner. The Smart-Contracts may be open-source, meaning anyone can review, verify, use, copy, modify, or distribute them, subject to the applicable licence terms. You are responsible for thoroughly reviewing and assessing the Smart-Contracts and related software before using them and must conduct your own independent research before making the purchase decision. We do not control or operate the underlying blockchain networks or the software through which such networks are formed. Therefore, we are not responsible or liable in connection with the Smart-Contracts’ underlying blockchain networks or related software, and their operation, functioning, or use. You accept all associated risks, including potential losses or damages resulting therefrom.

## 6. Term and Termination

### a. Term

These T&C will be in full force until terminated in accordance with the terms prescribed herein.

### b. Termination

You shall not have the right to terminate these T&Cs without our prior consent. We may reject and terminate your participation in the Genesis Auction at any time with or without reason, and without notice and any liability whatsoever, in which case all our obligations on the sale, transfer, and distribution of the Tokens shall immediately cease and be of no further effect. If the termination occurs before the Closing, depending on the ground of the termination, you may be entitled to a refund for any undistributed Tokens, provided that the final decision on any refund shall be made by us at our sole discretion, given the circumstances of refund, and further provided that the refund, if any, shall be made to the same Wallet you have used to participate in the Genesis Auction. These T&C shall be deemed automatically terminated upon the occurrence of the earliest of the following events: (i) termination of the Genesis Auction by us; (ii) termination or cessation of your participation in the Genesis Auction; or (iii) the Closing.

### c. Survival

Sections 6, 8-13, 15, 17-20, as well as any other terms herein construed to survive the termination of these T&S shall survive any expiration or termination of these T&C or the Genesis Auction, regardless of reason.

If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop participating in the Genesis Auction.

### b. Communication

We will send you information electronically about these T&C, and Genesis Auction, including via the Communication Channels we choose. These communications will be considered official and delivered the day after they are sent or published. You can contact us at [hello@xmaquina.io](mailto:hello@xmaquina.io). We might ask for additional information or action to verify your identity.

You shall always carefully assess and verify any information you access or receive via Communication Channels. You must cross-verify any hyperlinks and wallet addresses provided through the Communication Channels for authenticity, correctness, and accuracy by cross-referencing them with our other Communication Channels or through our officially designated moderators before relying on or using such information or details, or performing any transactions involving Virtual Assets. Be extra cautious regarding any hyperlinks or wallet addresses, or instructions on executing blockchain transactions which are shared only through one Communication Channel. There is always a risk that one or more of our Communication Channels may be compromised, which is a common occurrence in the blockchain space, resulting in unauthorised third parties gaining control over them and posting or sending misleading information in an attempt to steal or gain control over your assets. Accordingly, you hereby assume such risks and the responsibility to reasonably verify and assess any and all information you receive or access through our Communication Channels, at the very least by means mentioned herein. Neither we nor any of the Xmaquina Parties shall be held liable or responsible for, or in connection with, your reliance upon or use of unauthentic or misleading information or communications shared through the Communication Channels as a result of our loss of control or their compromise. We hereby disclaim any duty of care with respect thereto and shall not be held liable or responsible for any damages or losses sustained by you in connection with, or resulting from, the compromise of our Communication Channels.

c. Entire Agreement

These T&C and any incorporated documents constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding all prior and contemporaneous understandings, writings, or promises related to the subject matter. You acknowledge and confirm that you will not rely on and have no remedies in respect of any warranty, statement, promise, assurance, or statement (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these T&C.

d. Third-Party Beneficiaries

These T&C shall inure to the benefit of the Xmaquina Parties and any of the Xmaquina Parties shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce the provisions of these T&C as if they were a party hereto. However, no consent, approval or notice of Xmaquina Parties shall be required to alter, assign, novate, or otherwise change these T&C.

e. No Waiver

Our failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under these T&C or by law does not waive that right or remedy. Similarly, a partial or single exercise of a right or remedy does not preclude further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

When using smart-contracts, there are no legal agreements, promises of payment, or courts of law, and therefore there are no investments or other traditional transactions involved.

Schedule 1 : Risk Disclosure Statement

1. General Blockchain Risks

a. Irreversibility

Please note that transactions on a public blockchain are irreversible. We do not and cannot control or influence transactions with Virtual Assets and, therefore, are not able to cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions on a blockchain network. You must independently assess risks and make informed decisions before carrying out any transactions. We do not warrant that transactions will be executed with the gas fees you expect or that they will be executed at all, including because of high network demand.

b. Autonomy of Infrastructure

Blockchain-based infrastructure operates autonomously and is typically beyond anyone’s control. Any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the underlying blockchain could significantly impact the Project, Tokens, or related Virtual Asset transactions. You are responsible for conducting thorough research before engaging with the Tokens.

c. Privacy and Data Risks

Blockchain data is publicly accessible and traceable by third parties, meaning transactions in Virtual Assets may expose certain information about you, though it is unlikely to directly reveal your identity. However, when combined with other personal information, it may allow third parties to infer your financial standing. Once recorded, blockchain data cannot be altered or deleted, making the decision to transact entirely your responsibility.

d. Risk Associated with Hard Fork

A hard fork in the underlying blockchain network of the Tokens, or any of its components, could require major changes. These changes might make the Smart-Contracts incompatible, dysfunctional, impractical, or more expensive to use. This could disrupt the execution and interaction of Smart-Contracts critical to the Genesis Auction. Adapting to a hard fork or changes in consensus rules may require significant time and resources, which might not be available or cost-effective. Consequently, the Project continued operation cannot be guaranteed.

e. Risk Associated with Cryptography Development

Advances in cryptography and technology, particularly quantum computing, could threaten blockchain systems by weakening or breaking the cryptographic consensus mechanisms that underpin them. As quantum computing evolves, algorithms once considered secure may become obsolete, leaving systems that rely on traditional cryptographic methods vulnerable. This could allow intruders to bypass existing security measures, compromise data integrity, as well as disrupt consensus mechanisms on blockchain networks.

2. Financial and Market Risks

a. Risk of Loss

Transacting with Virtual Assets involves the risk of monetary or other losses. These risks can arise from various factors, including market volatility, vulnerabilities in Smart-Contracts, cybersecurity threats such as hacking or phishing attacks, technical failures, regulatory changes, etc. Unforeseen events, including economic downturns, changes in market sentiment, etc, could also have a material adverse effect on your assets.

b. Virtual Assets’ Value Risks

In general, Virtual Assets are not backed by any physical assets and do not have any intrinsic value. We make no representations or warranties, whether express or implied, regarding Virtual Assets, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. These are expressly disclaimed. You acknowledge that: (i) we do not warrant any inherent value with regard to Virtual Assets; (ii) there is no assurance Virtual Assets will gain value, will hold any particular value or price, or have any value at all; and (iii) we make no promises about future performance or value with respect to Virtual Assets, their price, supply amount, etc. Purchasing, storing, using, or disposing of Virtual Assets is entirely at your own risk.

c. Volatility Risks

Purchasing, using, or holding Virtual Assets involves significant risks. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can change drastically in short periods, potentially leading to substantial or total loss of your funds. Due to the nature and operation of blockchain protocols, the total amount of Virtual Assets in circulation could increase through, inter alia, the adoption of a new patch, upgrade of the source code, or additional mint. In no event shall we be responsible for or held liable in connection with any damages or losses that you may incur as a result of or in connection with the change in the composition, supply, value or price of any Virtual Assets. You are solely responsible for evaluating these risks, making informed decisions, and bearing any consequences, including losses. Only allocate funds to Virtual Assets that you can afford to lose.

d. Liquidity and Market Risks

There is no assurance that an active market will exist now or in the future for buying or selling Virtual Assets. Their price and liquidity cannot be assured, and it is possible that there may be no market or liquidity for Virtual Assets at all. In some cases, they may become useless or abandoned entirely. Specifically, we make no assurances that the Tokens will be listed on any exchanges, that a market for the Tokens will exist or develop, or that their prices will remain consistent across different platforms.

3. Risks Associated with Project

a. Project Pivot

The design, essence, particulars and description of the Project, including related products and services, may be amended or changed at any time without notice. There is no assurance that the Project will be developed, operated or maintained for any particular time period or at all. The Project may be pivoted at any time. Nothing in the T&C or Materials imposes an obligation to develop, deploy, launch, promote, or operate the Project, the Token, or any related products or services.

b. Public Interest Uncertainty

Public interest in the Project is not warranted, and low user engagement may negatively impact its development and associated business activities.

c. Risk of Confusing Interface

The user interface, design of the Project or associated infrastructure may sometimes cause confusion, leading to unintended actions or transactions, such as selecting the wrong Virtual Asset, transaction type, blockchain network, or account.

d. Risk of Unofficial Projects

There is always a risk of alternative projects or competing teams, including those creating similar products or forking (cloning) the Project and its associated software or components, which could negatively affect the Project. Additionally, you may be targeted by fraudulent activities, including fake websites, emails, text messages, or social media accounts impersonating us or the Project. They may aim to deceive you, steal your Virtual Assets, or otherwise profit unlawfully. Exercise extreme caution when interacting with websites, emails, text messages, and social media accounts, directing you to sources other than the official Project-associated websites or applications, or those asking you to connect your Wallet. Always verify the authenticity of any communication claiming to represent the Project.

4. Technological Risks

a. Functionality and Flawed Logic of Software

The Tokens and associated technical infrastructure are provided “as is” and may experience system failures, downtimes, unplanned interruptions in their underlying network or functionality, hardware or software defects, security breaches, or other causes that could adversely affect the Tokens or your access to them. We are not obligated to address these issues and do not warrant that any updates will resolve existing bugs or vulnerabilities, or avoid creating new, unanticipated issues.

b. Software Weaknesses, Bugs and Vulnerabilities

The Tokens-related software, including Smart-Contracts, as well as underlying logic of blockchain networks for Virtual Assets may contain weaknesses, flaws, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects, or impairments. This can cause the software or Smart-Contracts to operate incorrectly or not as expected, potentially resulting in transactions being executed contrary to their intended logic or your intents. Such issues can lead to the partial or complete loss of Virtual Assets involved in a transaction or other adverse outcomes.

c. Lack of Remediation

The software and Smart-Contracts may contain errors or vulnerabilities that are not immediately apparent. Addressing these issues can be challenging and may not always be effective. Additionally, many Smart-Contracts are immutable by design, meaning they cannot be modified once deployed. Efforts to remediate flaws, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in blockchain software may be disruptive, risky, complex, expensive, and time-consuming. There is no warranty that such efforts will succeed in preventing adverse outcomes, including the potential complete or substantial loss of your Virtual Assets transferred to any Smart-Contracts.

d. Downtime and Maintenance

The Tokens-related services, products, or their components may occasionally become inaccessible or inoperable for various reasons, including maintenance, updates, technical disruptions, or third-party interference. Such occurrences may lead to downtime or a lack of access to them. These interruptions could result in delays or cancellations of transactions, an inability to complete transactions, and/or partial or complete loss of the Virtual Assets involved in those transactions.

e. Delayed Updates

There is no warranty that the software, including Smart-Contracts, the Project relies on will be updated quickly enough to address new threats, vulnerabilities, or required changes, or can be updated at all. Delays in updates can leave users exposed to risks such as errors, failed transactions, inability to execute time-sensitive operations, or the loss of Virtual Assets.

5. Security Risks

a. Risk of Theft

The blockchain networks can be attacked which may result in downtime, consensus split, long reorganisation of the chain, 51% attack or other adverse outcomes. There is no warranty that there will be no theft or loss of Virtual Assets due to attacks, hacks, software flaws, or blockchain vulnerabilities, which could result in partial or complete loss of the Virtual Assets. Even when using our official resources, remain vigilant for pop-ups or unusual program behaviour, as these could result from hacks or malicious code.

b. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities

Bugs, flaws in logic, and other vulnerabilities are not part of the intended operation of the Project-related software and Smart-Contracts. However, intruders may exploit these weaknesses or flaws, potentially causing financial losses, data breaches, or system malfunctions. The exploitation of bugs, flaws, or vulnerabilities in Smart-Contracts or associated software is strictly prohibited, regardless of the purpose or circumstances. Such acts, especially those that harm other users, may be considered criminal or other offences under applicable laws and could result in severe consequences for those involved.

c. Risk Associated with Credentials

If a third party gains access to your Wallet or its Credentials, they may control and use your Virtual Assets held in such Wallet. To reduce this risk, secure your electronic devices or systems (both hardware and software) used in relation to the Wallet and/or Project, as well as the Credentials against unauthorised access. We encourage you to properly back up all Credentials associated with your Wallets used in connection with Genesis Auction and the Project.

6. Risks Related to Materials

a. Accuracy

There is no assurance that any Materials will be true, accurate, complete, timely or non-misleading, and you expressly acknowledge and agree that we will be under no obligation to update or fix them. You shall solely evaluate all information provided by us or on our behalf.

b. Risk of Impersonation

Reliance on the Materials, whether in whole or in part, and any use of them, is entirely at your own discretion and risk. Always verify that any information you believe to be from us is posted or communicated by our authorised representatives. Be cautious of impersonation risks, including fake websites, counterfeit tokens resembling the Tokens, and fraudulent social media accounts or communications. Always ensure you are interacting with legitimate and verified sources. Verify information independently before acting.

c. Forward-Looking Statements

The Materials may contain opinions, forecasts, projections, future plans, or other statements about the Project and our business activities, excluding statements of historical fact. These are considered forward-looking statements based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. There are no warranties that these statements will be accurate, and actual events, results, or outcomes may differ significantly. Do not place undue reliance on such statements. Risks and uncertainties may arise from economic conditions, competition, technical issues, and other factors affecting us, Affiliates, or the Project.

d. Disparity of Information

You acknowledge that we may possess material non-public information regarding the Tokens and the Project that is not available to you and that this information may impact the value of Tokens. You understand the disadvantage to which you may be subject due to the disparity of information between you and us.

e. Updates

The Materials may be updated from time to time with or without notice depending on various circumstances, including market conditions, applicable regulation, and governments’ actions.

7. Third-Party Interaction Risks

a. Third-Party Services

When interacting with the Project or its components, you may encounter Third-Party Services. Should any of these Third-Party Services exhibit vulnerabilities, encounter operational disruptions, or experience downtime, it could adversely impact the functionality and operation of the Project-related software and infrastructure. In severe cases, such issues may lead to the compromise of your assets. We do not endorse, recommend, or solicit to use any Third-Party Services and are not responsible for any such Third-Party Services, their functionality, or any associated risks. Your use of Third-Party Services, and your interactions with third parties are at your own risk and subject to the terms set by the respective third-party operators.

b. Counterparty Risks

You should always be diligent when dealing with third parties regarding Tokens. Such third parties may include, without limitation, exchanges, custodians, Wallet operators, service providers, fiat gateways, banks, or payment systems. Interactions with third parties carry risks, including fraud, insolvency, contract breaches, or security failures, which could result in the loss of your Virtual Assets.

c. Third-Party Illegal Behaviour

Due to the nature of permissionless blockchain software, there is a risk that the Project or its components could be misused by third parties for illegal activities, such as fraud, etc. Such misuse could result in legal and regulatory consequences affecting the Project’s operation and development. While we cannot control users’ actions, any misuse could expose us, the Project, and its users to lawsuits, government investigations, or other enforcement actions. These consequences may lead to liability and reputational harm for us and Affiliates, potentially disrupting the Project operation, hindering its development, and negatively impacting our business activities.

d. Inaccurate Data

The Project and its infrastructure may rely on and derive certain information from third-party data sources in an automated manner, such as oracles, third-party APIs, etc. This information is not manually verified or checked, and as a result, it may be incorrect, incomplete, outdated, inaccurate, or insufficient. In certain situations, immediate action may be required, and timely analysis of the available data is essential for making informed decisions. However, delays in the delivery of necessary information may occur, posing an inherent risk. The inability to act promptly due to such delays could result in partial or complete loss of Virtual Assets. You should always exercise caution when relying on any third-party data.

8. Regulatory and Compliance Risks

a. Legal Uncertainty

The Project and related activities may be subject to various laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate, including obtaining different licences or other permissive documents, if so directed by applicable laws. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations, or evolving interpretations of existing law could, in certain circumstances, result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures, which could affect the development, operation, and maintenance of the Project. In extreme cases, certain jurisdictions might even ban or severely restrict Project-related activities. Be aware that the legal status of Virtual Assets and transactions involving them remains uncertain, and some jurisdictions may impose full prohibitions on owning or transacting in them, which could apply to you. Penalties for any such potential violation would be unknown. You should independently research the legal implications of interacting with Virtual Assets, including all applicable tax requirements.

b. Taxation

Any acquisition, holding, use or disposition of Virtual Assets, as well as any transactions carried out in relation to the Project, may have tax implications for you as imposed by state or government authorities. Tax laws and their interpretations concerning Virtual Assets may be unclear or not well-defined in your jurisdiction. Additionally, current interpretations of tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and existing laws may be amended retroactively. You are solely responsible for understanding and fulfilling your tax obligations. Failure to properly collect, withhold, report, or remit applicable Taxes may lead to penalties, fines, or other legal consequences. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional advice to ensure compliance with all applicable tax requirements.

9. Unanticipated Risks

In addition to the risks set forth herein, there are unanticipated risks. Further risks may materialise as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.

b. to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;

c. to request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal or technical reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;

d. to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;

e. to request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (1) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy, (2) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it, (3) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, (4) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;

f. to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;

g. to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent;

h. not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of data, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affecting you;

i. to file a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority in case we violate your rights or obligations imposed on us under the applicable data protection legislation. The relevant supervisory authority will particularly depend on where you are located. In order to exercise your rights as a data subject, we may request certain information from you to verify your identity and confirm that you have the right to exercise such rights.

Transactions during the Genesis Auction are processed and recorded on applicable blockchain networks. Data recorded on blockchain networks is publicly accessible, meaning anyone can view information about blockchain transactions. While the Wallet Data, such as wallet addresses and transaction IDs, is not considered personal data or personally identifiable information on its own, it can become one when combined with other data. Therefore, certain particular individuals may be identified and their personal information may become publicly available. Additionally, blockchain networks are generally immutable, meaning that no one can modify or delete data once it has been recorded on the blockchain. Therefore, you, we, or any other person will not be able to correct or erase data recorded on the blockchain network. Therefore, certain privacy or data protection rights may be limited.
