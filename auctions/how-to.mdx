## Part 1. Getting Ready to Participate

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

The first step is to connect your metamask wallet. Start by clicking the connect button at the top right corner of the genesis auction website. Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Ensure eligible tokens are on the Base Network.

The Genesis Auction portal only supports Metamask and Coinbase wallet.

### Setting up a Metamask Wallet

To add Base as a custom network to MetaMask:

1. Open the MetaMask browser extension.
2. Open the network selection dropdown menu by clicking the dropdown button at the top of the extension.
3. Click the **Add network** button.
4. Click **Add a network manually**.
5. In the **Add a network manually** dialog that appears, enter the following information for Base mainnet:

   To pick up a draggable item, press the space bar. While dragging, use the arrow keys to move the item. Press space again to drop the item in its new position, or press escape to cancel.

6. **Tap the Save button **to save Base as a network.

You should now be able to connect to the Base by selecting it from the network selection dropdown menu.

### Setting up a Coinbase Wallet

The [Coinbase Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad?hl=en) browser extension provides support for Base by default.

To use Base with Coinbase Wallet:

1. Open the Coinbase Wallet browser extension and log in to your account.
2. Connect to an app using Coinbase Wallet.
3. Open the network selection menu by clicking the network icon in the upper right-hand corner.
4. Select **Base**.

Your active network should now be switched to Base.

### 2. Fund Your Wallet with ETH for Transaction Fees

You will need ETH to interact with the Base network. Every transaction on the Base network has a transaction fee that must be paid in ETH. This fee is referred to as a ‘gas’ fee.

The Base network is cost-effective, so you won’t need much ETH tokens to pay for transactions.

### 3. Fund Your Wallet with USDC

To participate in the auction, you will need **Bid Tokens**. Those are the tokens that are eligible and can be used to acquire DEUS receipt tokens.

Wave 1.5 will use USDC tokens exclusively. Ensure you fund your wallet with the necessary USDC tokens to participate.

More token options will be offered in subsequent waves.

## Part 2. Acquiring Receipt Tokens via Swap

### 1. Explore Auction Status and Live Info

On the Genesis Auction website ([genesis.xmaquina.io](http://genesis.xmaquina.io)), you can check the status of the latest auction right on the homepage. The auction will consist of multiple waves, with as many waves as needed to sell all the Genesis Auction allocated tokens. We expect the auction to conclude within 3 to 4 total waves.

You can sign up to receive email notifications about the start of each auction wave. While each wave is expected to last about two to four weeks, high demand may cause a wave to close in a much shorter time period.

For updates, you can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xmaquina), follow us on [X](https://x.com/xmaquinaDAO) and enable notifications to stay informed.

### 2. Wave Auction Information

Terms may vary with each wave:

- Early Waves: Lower swap rates.
- Later Waves: Higher swap rates with potentially different unlock percentages at TGE, depending on demand and market conditions.

For each wave, you’ll see:

- Swap rate (per DEUS).

- Confirm with MetaMask: Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet.
