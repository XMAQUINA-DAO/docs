## Seeding The DAO

The Deus Genesis Auction is the way the DEUS token is distributed to the community. It is designed to distribute ownership of DEUS to the public while bootstrapping the DAOâ€™s treasury ahead of the DEUS token becoming transferable.

This initiative aims to establish the DAO by building a diversified multi-token treasury to support funding, governance, DeFi liquidity strategies, and ecosystem incentives.

30% of the total DEUS token supply is allocated to the Genesis Auction, structured as an open on-chain community launch. Unlike the current standard in crypto, which often reserves a large portion of the supply to Venture Capital backers, this auction ensures equal terms for all participants.

A total of 71% of the DEUS token supply is dedicated to the XMAQUINA community.

The final Genesis allocation will be determined by factors such as wave valuations, market demand, and prevailing conditions. By prioritizing broad participation, the auction seeks to build a strong, engaged community of stakeholders and lay the groundwork for decentralized governance from the start.

## Auction Format

The Genesis Auction will proceed in successive waves. During each wave, participants can exchange select eligible tokens such as ETH, BTC, USDC, and DePIN or DePAI related tokens for receipt tokens representing their future DEUS allocations. The selection of eligible tokens may vary across Genesis waves, enabling the DAO to strategically build a diversified treasury of strategic assets.

### Receipt Tokens

Upon participating, contributors will receive non-transferable receipt tokens, which provide two key benefits:

1. **Token Claiming:** Receipt tokens can be redeemed for DEUS in line with their respective vesting schedule through the DAO Portal.
2. **Meta-Governance:** Auction contributors can immediately participate in early governance, influencing foundational DAO decisions through voting.

## Auction Pricing and Participation

Each wave will feature a fixed swap price based on market averages and strategic considerations to ensure transparency and fairness. The vesting schedule and swap rates for each wave will be announced prior to its start. Details for Wave 3 of the Genesis Auction will be shared mid September 2025.

## Why a Community Auction?

To ensure equitable access and prevent manipulation:

- **Participation Caps:** Certain waves may limit the amount that can be contributed per address to ensure fair access for all participants.
- **Diversified Treasury Goals:** The DAO will strategically structure swaps to build a robust and balanced asset portfolio aligned with long-term objectives.

This structured auction design provides multiple benefits:

- **Transparency:** Clear value exchange adds confidence in the process.
- **Stability:** Fixed pricing and market-based strategies smooth out fluctuations, ensuring fairness for participants.
- **Community**: Equal terms and open access create a stronger, more engaged community of stakeholders.

## Claiming Your Tokens & TGE

Details about the claiming process will be announced in May.

- **Token Claim:** The claiming process is explained in this blog and completed through the [DAO Portal](https://genesis.xmaquina.io/portfolio).
- **TGE**: The Token Generation Event date will be shared shortly after the final Genesis Auction concludes.
