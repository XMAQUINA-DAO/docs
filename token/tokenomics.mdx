# Token parameters

- Ticker: DEUS
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion)
- Max Supply: Capped at 1 billion
- Token Status: Non-transferable

The DEUS supply is allocated across eight categories, as outlined in the chart and table below.

# Token supply distribution

- \*\*Genesis Auction: 30% \*\*Allocation for the community auction, enabling multi-token swaps during auction waves for DEUS and seeding the DAO’s treasury. Any unsold tokens from the auction will be reallocated to the DAO Treasury.
- **DAO Treasury: 30%** Tokens reserved for the DAO’s treasury, unlocking according to a predetermined schedule. This schedule may be adjusted through future governance decisions. Those tokens can only used via a DAO vote.
- **Liquidity & Adoption: 3.5%** Allocated for CEX listings, market-making, and marketing initiatives to drive early adoption and community growth.
- **Strategic Contributor Fundraise: 8%** Strategic contributors who participated in the pre-seed round to support the early development of the DAO and its infrastructure.
- \*\*Advisors: 1% \*\*Allocated to advisors who review funding proposals, develop investment theses, provide vote recommendations, and propose exit strategies before presenting projects for voting.
- \*\*Core Contributors: 12.5% \*\*XMAQUINA’s founding members and core developers who initiated the project and guided its transition into a DAO transferring ownership of the developed infrastructure and IP.
- **Foundation: 7.5%** Allocated to the DAO’s foundation to engage service providers involved in DAO operations, including implementing DAO initiatives, development, marketing, growth, and hiring.
- **DEUS Development Lab: 7.5%** The in-house innovation hub for developing robotics, ethical AI, and decentralized technologies. Open to DAO members, it transforms R&D into market ready products, enabling the DAO to create impactful ventures that may evolve into spin-outs. Those tokens can only used via a DAO vote.
