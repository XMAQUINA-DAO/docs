# Your Stake In Physical AI

The DEUS token is the coordination layer that powers the entire XMAQUINA ecosystem. It grants holders voting rights over the DAO’s treasury and strategic direction, enabling collective ownership of Physical AI.

By staking DEUS, members participate directly in decisions around capital allocation, project funding, and the launch of new SubDAOs. This ensures that the ecosystem remains aligned with the community’s priorities while maintaining transparency and decentralization through on-chain governance.

Value generated from asset appreciation, successful exits, machine operations, the launchpad, SubDAO activity, and DAO incubations flows back into the ecosystem. Governance can allocate these proceeds to token burns, staking rewards, or other approved initiatives, ensuring transparent distribution in line with the priorities of DEUS holders. This creates a flywheel where those who stake, build, and govern are rewarded for their contributions as the machine economy grows.

# DEUS Token Utility

- **Governance Rights:** DEUS grants holders governance rights over the DAO’s treasury, allowing them to vote on key decisions, allocations, and overall strategy. This empowers participants to actively shape the DAO’s future direction.
- **Value Distribution Governance**: DEUS holders govern how value generated across the ecosystem is distributed. This includes outcomes from machine operations, SubDAO activity, and successful exits. Governance participants can propose and vote to direct this value toward token burns, staking programs, or treasury growth, ensuring that value created by the DAO is distributed transparently and in alignment with the community’s priorities.
- **Multi-Asset Treasury Exposure**: Gain exposure to the collective governance of a treasury filled with previously inaccessible opportunities, including equity in private robotics companies, strategic Physical AI assets and tokenized intellectual property.
- **Token Supply Governance:** The DAO may implement strategies to promote sustainable tokenomics and long-term value alignment, which may include supply adjustments, token buy backs, token sales, and other measures benefiting DEUS holders.
- \*\*Incentives: \*\*Active DAO members who complete bounties, contribute to DAO units, or support ecosystem growth can earn token rewards, encouraging long-term engagement and meaningful contributions.
- **DAO Initiatives**: The DAO may deploy tokens in DeFi to generate additional value and support growth. Governance can decide how this value is directed.
