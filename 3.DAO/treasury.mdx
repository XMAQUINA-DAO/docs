# Initial Treasury Composition

The treasury is structured to balance mission-aligned assets, high-growth opportunities, and diversified exposure.

- **70% Equity stake in Humanoid Robotics Companies** Equity stakes in leading private firms advancing humanoid robotics and next-gen Physical AI.

  We anticipate a 10x annual increase in active humanoid robots over the next six years ([read our 10x thesis](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/why-robotics-investments-are-outperforming-crypto)), driven by breakthroughs in manufacturing, AI, and real-world deployment. Most of these companies are expected to remain private in the near term, limiting access for retail. Given that the humanoid robotics market is unlikely to follow a winner-takes-all dynamic, the DAO is building a diversified portfolio, targeting companies across regions and use cases.
- **15% DePIN and DePAI Tokens** Strategic token holding in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), decentralized physical AI (DePAI) ecosystems. These assets are typically acquired at an early stage through Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), often during pre-seed or seed phases. Opportunities that are generally inaccessible to retail participants. This allocation strengthens the DAO’s integration within the broader Web3 and decentralized technology ecosystem, with a particular focus on enabling Decentralized Physical AI. DePIN networks will play a vital role in real-world data collection, positioning, and spatial computing. Core foundations for helping Physical AI systems locate themselves, interact with the environment, and perform reliably. High-quality data is essential for training and deploying humanoid robotics at scale. For a deeper dive, see: [How DePIN Powers Location for Physical AI](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/how-depin-powers-location-for-physical-ai).
- **15% Machine Real-World Assets (Machine RWAs)** Tokenized autonomous systems such as robotics fleets, vertical farms, and service machines deployed in real-world environments. These assets are held by the DAO and governed by DEUS holders. They are typically integrated into existing operations managed by manufacturers or business partners, while economic activity and value flows are transparently coordinated on-chain. This category grounds the DAO’s mission in tangible, productive infrastructure.

**Liquidity**

A portion of the treasury is maintained in stablecoins to ensure operational agility. This reserve enables the DAO to respond to high-priority proposals without delay, especially given that community governance processes require time for deliberation and execution. Maintaining liquidity avoids the need for reactive asset liquidations.

# Evolution of the Treasury Over Time

The XMAQUINA DAO treasury is designed to evolve alongside the humanoid robotics industry. As adoption scales and new infrastructure emerges, the treasury will adapt accordingly.

**Phase 1: Accumulation** This initial phase is characterized by intense competition and early-stage deployments, such as proofs-of-concept (PoCs) with select partners (e.g., Figure with BMW, Apptronik with Mercedes-Benz). Opportunities for widespread deployment of autonomous robots will remain limited during this period. The treasury’s primary objective will be to accumulate equity stakes in the most promising humanoid robotics companies, positioning the DAO to capitalize on their long-term growth.

**Phase 2: Expansion and Diversification **As the sector moves beyond PoCs into real-world deployments, commercial traction will accelerate. The treasury will begin to diversify across the broader humanoid robotics ecosystem—supporting adjacent layers like cloud AI, coordination protocols, and fleet operations.

At the same time, more capital will flow into Machine-Based Real-World Assets (Machine RWAs), such as autonomous fleets and service robotics that generate real-world economic activity. The goal is to balance long-term exposure with income-generating assets governed by the DAO.

**Phase 3: Tokenization and Maturity** In this phase, the market will have priced in most of the growth potential of established players. The treasury will increasingly focus on Machine RWAs that are owned by the DAO, with revenue flowing on-chain and governed by DEUS holders.

This is where Machine DeFi emerges as a key unlock. Productive machine assets, such as autonomous vertical farms can serve as collateral for on-chain lending, allowing the DAO to access liquidity without selling long-term positions.

Phase 3 represents the full realization of XMAQUINA’s mission: a decentralized, self-governed machine economy built around co-ownership, co-creation, and co-governance.

Throughout these phases, the treasury will dynamically adjust to industry trends, community governance decisions, and market opportunities, ensuring alignment with the DAO’s mission.

# Crypto Yield Allocation

The DAO treasury includes components designed to generate on-chain yield through decentralized protocols.

#### **Yield-Generating Components**

**•Liquid Crypto Assets:**  A portion of the DAO’s liquid crypto holdings may be staked or deployed in decentralized exchanges or DeFi protocols to generate ongoing yield.

**• Stablecoins:** Utilized in DeFi strategies to generate passive returns and maintain operational flexibility.

**• Liquid DEUS Tokens:** A portion of the DAO’s DEUS holdings may be allocated to liquidity pools to support deep liquidity and token availability across major ecosystems, while generating yield for the DAO.

**Allocation Strategy**

During the accumulation phase, yield generated from DeFi protocols will be converted into stablecoins to strengthen the DAO’s liquid reserves. These reserves will be used to expand the DAO’s exposure to robotics companies and mission-aligned tokens.

The goal is to increase the amount of robotics equity and DePAI tokens held within the DAO treasury.

Initially, crypto yield will be split: 50% will remain in the DAO Treasury to acquire additional assets, and 50% will flow to the Profit Bucket, governed by DEUS token stakers. The community may vote to allocate these funds toward DEUS buybacks or staking programs, initiatives benefiting DEUS holders.

### Machine-Generated Yield

The DAO’s real-world machine assets generate revenue in fiat currency through commercial operations. While denominated in fiat, this machine-driven economic activity is brought on-chain in a permissionless and decentralized way.

### Yield Source

**Machine Real-World Assets:** Examples include vertical farms, robotic cafés, and autonomous service machines. These systems operate in real-world environments, generating revenue through product sales, usage fees, or subscriptions.

**On-Chain Conversion and Distribution**

Fiat-denominated yield is made on-chain using decentralized infrastructure such as [bridge.xyz](http://bridge.xyz), which enables conversion to stablecoins and execution of distribution via smart contracts. This process ensures that off-chain revenue is transparently routed to the DAO in a fully decentralized, trustless manner, without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

During the accumulation phase, machine-based yield will follow the same structure as crypto-based yield:

• 50% will flow to the DAO's Treasury in stablecoins and used to expand exposure to robotics companies and mission-aligned assets.

• 50% will be directed to the Profit Bucket, governed by DEUS stakers. The community may vote to use these funds for DEUS buybacks, staking programs, or other on-chain mechanisms that benefit token holders.

The goal remains to increase the amount of robotics equity and DePAI tokens held within the DAO, while accruing value to the DEUS token and stakers.
