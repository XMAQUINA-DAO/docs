## Initial Treasury Composition

The XMAQUINA DAO treasury is structured with a concentrated focus on the humanoid robotics stack, balancing mission-aligned equity exposure with operational flexibility and strategic crypto assets.

## The Humanoid Tech Stack

The humanoid tech stack is wide and complex. The core focus in Q4 2025 is humanoid pure play and this will expand to the wider ecosystem in H1 2026.

## Target Allocation

The initial treasury composition targets the following allocation:

### **Equity Stakes in Humanoid Robotics Companies**

Direct equity positions in leading private firms advancing humanoid robotics and next-gen Physical AI.

The DAO is building a diversified portfolio across the entire humanoid robotics value chain—from hardware manufacturers and AI software platforms to deployment operators and infrastructure providers. We anticipate a 10x annual increase in active humanoid robots over the next six years (read our 10x thesis), driven by breakthroughs in manufacturing, AI, and real-world deployment.

Most of these companies are expected to remain private in the near term, limiting access for retail investors. Given that the humanoid robotics market is unlikely to follow a winner-takes-all dynamic, the DAO targets companies across regions, use cases, and technical specializations.

The current Robotics Portfolio can be seen on the DAO Portal. Please note that there is one line per transaction. The two lines for Apptronik means that 2 transactions have been executed.

### **Cash and Stablecoins**

Liquid reserves maintained in fiat and stablecoins to ensure operational agility. This reserve enables the DAO to respond to high-priority investment opportunities without delay, especially given that community governance processes require time for deliberation and execution. Maintaining liquidity avoids the need for reactive asset liquidations and positions the DAO to act decisively when exceptional opportunities arise.

The stablecoin of choice for the DAO is USDC.

### **Physical AI-Related Crypto Tokens**

Strategic token holdings in projects that directly support the humanoid robotics ecosystem.

### The DEUS Token in the Treasury

After the Token Generation Event (TGE), **30% of the total DEUS supply will still be controlled by the DAO**, representing a significant portion of the treasury's assets. This allocation ensures that:

- DEUS holders maintain meaningful governance rights over treasury decisions
- The DAO can deploy DEUS tokens strategically for partnerships and ecosystem development
- Token value accrues directly to the treasury as the humanoid robotics sector grows

A portion of the DAO's DEUS holdings may be allocated to liquidity pools to support deep liquidity and token availability across major ecosystems, while generating yield for the treasury.

## Evolution of the Treasury Over Time

The XMAQUINA DAO treasury is designed to evolve alongside the humanoid robotics industry. As adoption scales and new infrastructure emerges, the treasury will adapt accordingly.

### Phase 1: Humanoid Focus (Current)

This initial phase is characterized by intense competition and early-stage deployments, such as proofs-of-concept (PoCs) with select partners (e.g., Figure with BMW, Apptronik with Mercedes-Benz). Opportunities for widespread deployment of autonomous robots remain limited during this period.

**Treasury Objective**: Accumulate equity stakes in the most promising humanoid robotics companies, positioning the DAO to capitalize on their long-term growth. The focus is on companies building complete humanoid platforms and integrated systems.

### Phase 2: Full Stack Expansion

As the sector moves beyond PoCs into real-world deployments, commercial traction will accelerate. The treasury will continue to accumulate humanoid robotics companies' equity and begin to diversify across the broader humanoid robotics ecosystem, supporting adjacent layers like cloud AI, actuators manufacturers, coordination protocols, and fleet operations.

**Treasury Objective**: Balance concentrated exposure to market leaders with strategic positions in emerging infrastructure and enabling technologies across the full robotics stack.

### Phase 3: Growth and Scaling

During this phase, the humanoid robotics industry will experience rapid commercial adoption and scaling. Leading companies will demonstrate clear product-market fit, and the ecosystem will mature with established supply chains, standardized interfaces, and proven business models.

**Treasury Objective**: Continue accumulating equity in high-growth companies while selectively moving out of some positions that have achieved significant appreciation. Reinvest the proceeds into the next generation of robotics innovation and infrastructure.

### Phase 4: Maturity and Liquidity

In this phase, early-stage private companies will have matured, with many achieving liquidity events through IPOs, acquisitions, or secondary market access. The market will have priced in much of the growth potential of established players.

**Treasury Objective**: Realize gains from matured positions while maintaining strategic stakes in category-defining companies. Increased focus on yield-generating strategies and secondary market liquidity.

Throughout these phases, the treasury will dynamically adjust to industry trends, community governance decisions, and market opportunities, ensuring alignment with the DAO's mission of democratizing access to the humanoid robotics revolution.
