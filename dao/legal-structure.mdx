description: "Multi-entity legal framework connecting on-chain governance with compliant off-chain execution through MachineDAO LLC."
---

XMAQUINA operates through a structured multi-entity framework designed to connect on-chain governance with compliant offchain asset execution.

This structure ensures that governance authority and beneficial control remain aligned with the DAO, while enabling participation in real-world investment activities.

---

## **MachineDAO LLC (Marshall Islands)**

XMAQUINA DAO operates through MachineDAO LLC, a non-profit DAO LLC organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

MachineDAO LLC serves as the governance and treasury entity of the ecosystem. It is governed through on-chain DEUS token voting mechanisms and retains authority over capital deployment decisions.

MachineDAO LLC:

- Controls the on-chain treasury
- Approves capital allocation proposals
- Oversees subordinate entities involved in ecosystem operations

Participation in DAO governance does not constitute equity ownership in MachineDAO LLC unless expressly provided through separate legal agreements.

---

## **Supporting Entities**

To facilitate ecosystem operations, additional entities support specific functions within the structure.

These may include:

- A foundation entity responsible for executing offchain investments and holding legal title to assets on behalf of the DAO
- A special-purpose entity responsible for token issuance and related contractual matters

Each supporting entity operates within defined roles and does not supersede the governance authority of the DAO.

---

## **Governance Sovereignty**

All material capital deployment decisions originate from DAO governance processes.

The structure is designed to:

- Provide limited liability to participants
- Enable enforceable execution of governance-approved decisions
- Maintain alignment between token-based governance and offchain execution

Participation in the XMAQUINA ecosystem is voluntary and does not grant rights to profits, dividends, or financial returns unless explicitly defined under separate agreements.
