DEUS is the governance and coordination token of the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

It connects treasury strategy, protocol infrastructure, and ecosystem expansion under a unified system.

---

## **1. Treasury Participation**

DEUS enables participation in governing a treasury that includes equity positions in leading robotics and embodied AI companies.

By staking DEUS and minting xDEUS, holders vote on:

• Capital allocation into robotics companies

• Portfolio construction and treasury deployment

• Protocol development funding

• Strategic ecosystem initiatives

This structure allows the community to influence how robotics capital is deployed and managed.

## **2. Capital Allocation Decisions**

When value flows into the DAO treasury through protocol activity or realized asset events, governance determines how that capital is managed.

Approved proposals may direct treasury-held assets toward:

• Reinvestment into new robotics opportunities

• [Distributions to active xDEUS holders](https://docs.xmaquina.io/dao/governance-rewards) based on multiplier-weighted balances

• DEUS buybacks

• Strategic ecosystem expansion

All such actions require explicit governance approval.

## **3. RCM Protocol Integration**

The Robotics Capital Markets Protocol integrates DEUS as the base pairing asset for asset-specific markets anchored to robotics exposure.

Each asset listed within the protocol is paired against DEUS, placing the token at the center of protocol-level market activity.

Protocol fees that flow to the DAO treasury are governed by xDEUS holders.

## **4. Ecosystem Growth**

Through DEUS Labs and related initiatives, the DAO incubates robotics and Web3 ventures.

DAO-backed ventures may integrate DEUS into their product architecture or broader ecosystem design, where appropriate.

As new ventures go to market, DEUS may assume additional functional roles across the expanding ecosystem.

> **Legal clarification:** DEUS does not represent equity, ownership, or dividend rights in any underlying assets or portfolio companies. Participation in governance does not create entitlement to profits or financial returns.
