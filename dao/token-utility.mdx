title: "Token Utility"
---

DEUS is the governance and coordination token of the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

It functions as the decision layer across treasury strategy, Robotics Capital Markets infrastructure, and ecosystem development.

---

## **1. Treasury Governance**

DEUS holders govern a treasury composed of robotics aligned assets, including equity positions, strategic token allocations, and protocol generated reserves.

Through governance participation, token holders collectively determine how capital is allocated, retained, or deployed across the ecosystem.

DEUS does not represent equity, dividend rights, or direct ownership in any underlying portfolio company. Governance participation influences treasury strategy at the DAO level only.

---

## **2. Staked Governance**

DEUS must be staked to mint xDEUS, which grants voting rights.

Staked holders vote on:

• Treasury deployments

• Portfolio adjustments

• Protocol development

• Governance parameter updates

The staking mechanism aligns long term participation with capital decision making.

---

## **3. Governance Controlled Capital Allocation**

Where value accrues to the DAO, including protocol fees, treasury events, or ecosystem activity, governance determines how that value is managed.

Approved proposals may direct treasury held value toward:

• Strategic reinvestment

• Governance approved market operations involving DEUS

• Incentive mechanisms for active participants

• Infrastructure and ecosystem expansion

There is no automatic distribution mechanism. All allocations require governance approval. No economic outcomes are guaranteed.

---

## **4. Robotics Capital Markets Integration**

DEUS functions as the base pairing asset within the Robotics Capital Markets protocol.

Assets launched through RCM are paired against DEUS, integrating the token into liquidity formation across robotics aligned markets.

Protocol fees generated through RCM activity flow to the DAO treasury and remain subject to governance controlled allocation.

---

## **5. DAO Development and Spinouts**

Through development initiatives and incubations, the DAO supports robotics and decentralized infrastructure ventures.

Where the DAO holds strategic positions in such initiatives, governance determines capital management, integration strategy, and ecosystem alignment.

---

## **6. Value Flow Overview**

Value may enter the DAO treasury through:

• Genesis capital formation

• Protocol generated fees

• Strategic treasury events

• Approved ecosystem initiatives

DEUS serves as the governance mechanism through which treasury strategy and capital allocation decisions are made.

Utility evolves through governance decisions and ecosystem development.
