title: "Governance Parameters"
---

Governance parameters define the operational mechanics of proposal approval, staking configuration, and voting thresholds within XMAQUINA.

All governance parameters are configurable through approved governance proposals.

The governance interface reflects the current active configuration. Nothing in this section is permanently fixed.

---

## **Voting Thresholds**

Explicit vote proposals operate under a unified approval model.

For proposals requiring affirmative approval (e.g., BOT and XMQ):

• A quorum threshold must be met

• Approval requires majority support of participating xDEUS voting power

Quorum thresholds are defined within the governance interface and may be modified through governance.

---

## **Optimistic Governance & Veto**

Optimistic proposals (e.g., OPX and CDG) operate under a veto-based model.

Under this structure:

• Proposals execute unless vetoed within the defined veto window

• A veto participation threshold must be met to block execution

Veto window duration and veto thresholds are defined within the governance interface and are governance-configurable.

---

## **Voting Duration**

Voting periods are defined per proposal and are visible within the governance interface.

Typical voting periods align with governance epochs.

Voting duration is governance-configurable.

---

## **Staking Configuration**

The veToken model operates under configurable staking parameters.

Current configuration includes:

• Minimum stake per position

• Multiplier growth model and cap

• Minimum lock duration prior to withdrawal request

• Withdrawal cooldown period

All staking parameters are governance-configurable.

---

## **Multiplier Configuration**

Governance weight and reward weight are determined by a time-weighted multiplier.

The multiplier:

• Begins at a base value upon staking

• Increases progressively over time

• Caps at a defined maximum

Multiplier growth rate and cap are governance-configurable.

---

## **Proposal Eligibility**

Certain proposal types may require:

• Initiation by authorized DAO units

• A minimum xDEUS threshold for community initiation

Eligibility thresholds are governance-configurable and visible within the governance interface.

---

## **Treasury Routing**

Proposals are routed based on the treasury system they affect:

• Aragon OSx for assets held within DAO smart contract treasury

• Snapshot for signaling votes and proposals authorizing multisig-executed actions

Routing logic may evolve through governance.

---

## **Parameter Authority**

All governance parameters:

• Are publicly visible through governance venues

• May be updated via approved governance proposals

• Take effect upon successful approval and execution

Governance authority resides exclusively with xDEUS holders.
