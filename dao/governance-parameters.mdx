title: "Governance Parameters"
---

Governance parameters define the operational mechanics of proposal approval, staking configuration, and voting thresholds within XMAQUINA.

All parameters are configurable through approved governance proposals.

Nothing in this section is permanently fixed.

---

## **Voting Thresholds**

Governance proposals may be subject to quorum requirements depending on proposal type.

For explicit voting proposals (e.g., BOT, XMQ):

• A minimum quorum threshold must be met

• Approval requires majority support of participating xDEUS voting power

For optimistic proposals (e.g., OPX, CDG):

• Proposals pass unless vetoed within the defined veto window

• A minimum veto participation threshold may apply

Quorum thresholds are governance-configurable.

---

## **Voting Duration**

Voting duration is defined per proposal type and may vary depending on urgency and context.

Typical duration:

• One governance epoch

Voting periods are configurable through governance.

---

## **Veto Window**

Optimistic governance proposals include a defined veto period during which xDEUS holders may block execution.

• The veto window duration is governance-configurable

• If veto conditions are met within the window, the proposal does not execute

---

## **Staking Parameters**

The veToken model operates under configurable staking parameters.

Current configuration:

• Minimum stake per position: 100 DEUS

• Multiplier cap: 12x

• Minimum time before withdrawal request: 5 days

• Withdrawal cooldown period: 5 days

All staking parameters are governance-configurable.

---

## **Multiplier Configuration**

The voting and reward multiplier:

• Begins at 1x

• Increases progressively over time

• Caps at 12x after maximum accrual duration

Multiplier growth rate and cap are governance-configurable.

---

## **Proposal Eligibility**

Certain proposal types may require:

• Authorized DAO unit initiation

• Minimum xDEUS threshold for community initiation

Eligibility thresholds are governance-configurable.

---

## **Treasury Routing**

Proposals are routed based on affected treasury system:

• Aragon OSx for assets held within DAO smart contract treasury

• Snapshot for signaling and proposals authorizing multisig-executed actions

Routing logic may evolve via governance.

---

## **Parameter Authority**

All governance parameters may be modified through approved governance proposals.

Parameter updates:

• Must follow standard governance process

• Are publicly visible

• Take effect upon approval and execution

Governance authority resides exclusively with xDEUS holders.
