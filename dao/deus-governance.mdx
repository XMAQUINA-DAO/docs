description: "How DEUS token holders govern the DAO through a vote-escrowed xDEUS model with on-chain execution via Aragon."
---

XMAQUINA DAO is governed by DEUS token holders.

Governance determines:

- Treasury allocations
- Capital deployment decisions
- Ecosystem initiatives
- Protocol upgrades
- SubDAO mandates

The DAO operates under an on-chain governance framework powered by a vote-escrowed (veToken) model. Governance combines community proposal discussion, Snapshot signaling, and binding on-chain execution through Aragon.

DEUS holders must stake their tokens to mint xDEUS, the DAO’s non-transferable governance veToken, in order to participate in on-chain voting.

## **Governance Structure**

The governance system includes:

- veToken-based voting (xDEUS)
- Optimistic dual governance mechanisms
- Northstar Council delegated proposals
- Community-led proposal pathways
- On-chain execution via Aragon

This structure balances speed, decentralization, and accountability.
