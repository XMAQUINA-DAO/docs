description: "Step-by-step governance workflow from proposal origination through voting, approval, execution, and on-chain verification."
---

Governance actions follow a structured framework while allowing flexibility across different proposal types and operational contexts.

Proposals may relate to:

• Treasury allocations

• Equity investments

• Liquidity provisioning

• Ecosystem incentives

• Governance parameter updates

• Product or infrastructure initiatives

• Operational matters

---

### **1. Proposal Origination**

Proposals may originate through:

• Community discussion

• SubDAO initiatives

• Strategic mandates

• Time-sensitive opportunities

In some cases, preliminary work is conducted within a SubDAO or operational unit before formal submission. For material proposals, written briefings or proposal drafts are typically posted in the [XMAQUINA Discord](https://discord.gg/xmaquina) forum, and community calls may be held to provide context and address questions prior to voting.

---

### **2. Proposal Formation**

A formal proposal outlines:

• Strategic rationale

• Scope and objectives

• Capital requirements, if applicable

• Risks and potential outcomes

Depending on governance type, proposals may be initiated by authorized DAO units or eligible xDEUS holders.

---

### **3. Voting Venue**

Proposals are routed based on the treasury system they affect.

• [Aragon OSx](https://app.aragon.org/dao/base-mainnet/0xfEA21e0500022F34dE0a02Ae3A7D04dF923Ed020/dashboard?members=0xF02Ed0A44a093624a9e2362c261F33aa79e7f4Ea-multisig_2&proposals=all) is used for binding proposals that affect assets held directly within the on-chain DAO treasury smart contracts.

• [Snapshot](https://snapshot.xmaquina.io/) is used for signaling votes and for proposals that authorize actions executed through the governance-approved multisig treasury.

In all cases, capital movements follow approved DAO proposals.

Each proposal is submitted to a single governance venue based on its scope.

---

### **4. Approval**

Approval mechanics depend on governance type.

Certain proposals operate under optimistic governance and pass unless vetoed within the defined time-lock period.

Other proposals require explicit voting and must meet quorum thresholds.

Within explicit voting:

• Some proposals use a binary yes or no format

• Others may use multiple-choice or weighted voting formats

The voting format is defined in each proposal and visible within the governance venue.

Governance parameters may evolve through future proposals.

---

### **5. Execution**

Once approved, execution occurs through the appropriate treasury system:

• On-chain treasury contracts

• Governance-authorized multisig infrastructure for operational settlement

Execution strictly follows the approved mandate.

---

### **6. Verification**

Treasury wallet addresses are available via the [DAO Portal](https://dao.xmaquina.io/). All material capital movements follow approved DAO proposals, and balances and transactions can be independently verified on-chain.
