Governance within XMAQUINA is powered by xDEUS, a vote-escrowed governance token minted by staking DEUS.

DEUS must be staked to participate in governance. xDEUS represents a locked governance position and aligns long-term participation with decision-making influence.

## **What Is xDEUS**

xDEUS is a non-transferable governance token minted when DEUS is staked.

xDEUS:

• Grants voting rights across all governance types.

• Determines quorum participation

• Enables veto authority in optimistic governance models

• Represents time-weighted governance power

## **veToken Model**

XMAQUINA uses a vote-escrow model to align governance influence with long-term commitment.

Under this structure:

• DEUS is staked

• xDEUS is minted

• Governance weight increases with staking duration

This model rewards sustained participation and reduces short-term governance volatility.

Governance influence reflects both capital commitment and time commitment.

## **Multiplier Mechanics**

Effective multiplier is determined by:

• The amount of DEUS staked

• The duration DEUS remains staked

Each DEUS token begins with a base multiplier of 1x.

Voting power and reward weight increase progressively with staking duration, capped at 12x after 12 months.

Although multiplier updates occur per governance epoch, time progression is commonly referenced in monthly intervals for simplicity.

The same multiplier applies to:

• Voting power in governance proposals

• Share of staking reward distributions, where applicable

**Example:**

If 100 DEUS is staked:

• At staking start: 100 effective voting power and 1x reward weight

• Over time: both governance weight and reward multiplier increase progressively

• After reaching maximum duration: up to 1,200 effective voting power and 12x reward weight

The multiplier caps at 12x and does not increase further beyond that threshold.

## **Unstaking and Multiplier Reset**

If DEUS is unstaked:

• xDEUS is burned

• Voting power resets

• Any future staking begins again at the base 1x multiplier

For example:

If 100 DEUS has been staked for 12 months, it may have reached the maximum 12x multiplier, resulting in:

• 1,200 effective voting power

If that stake is withdrawn:

• The 1,200 governance weight is eliminated

• xDEUS is burned

If the same 100 DEUS is later restaked:

• Voting power restarts at 100

• Multiplier accrues again over time

• Maximum weight must be rebuilt through continuous staking

This structure reinforces long-term alignment by rewarding sustained participation rather than short-term staking cycles.

## **Soulbound Design**

xDEUS staking positions are represented as non-transferable soulbound NFTs.

Each staking transaction mints a distinct NFT corresponding to that specific stake.

These NFTs:

• Cannot be sold

• Cannot be transferred

• Cannot be delegated outside governance logic

Governance rights remain strictly tied to the wallet that initiated the stake.

Because staking positions are soulbound:

• Governance weight cannot be traded

• Voting power cannot be transferred independently of the underlying stake

• Participation remains aligned with long-term capital commitment

## **Governance & Incentive Alignment**

By linking both voting power and reward allocation to staking duration, XMAQUINA aligns governance authority with long-term participation.

The same multiplier-weighted balance governs:

• Voting authority

• Quorum weight

• Veto power

• Reward allocation, where applicable

This structure:

• Incentivizes sustained commitment

• Reduces short-term governance manipulation

• Aligns rewards with long-term contributors

• Encourages ecosystem stewardship

Governance influence and incentive allocation operate through a unified multiplier model.
