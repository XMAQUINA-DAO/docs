title: "Governance Types"
---

XMAQUINA governance operates through defined proposal categories and execution venues. While proposals may differ in scope and impact, voting mechanics remain consistent across the DAO.

Governance decisions are executed through either Aragon or Snapshot, depending on where affected assets are held and how execution must occur.

---

## **Governance Venues**

### **Aragon Governance**

Aragon governance is used for proposals that directly affect assets held within the Aragon DAO smart contract treasury.

This includes:

• Onchain treasury transactions within the Aragon contract

• Governance parameter updates

• Smart contract-level actions

When a proposal concerns assets or logic contained within the Aragon DAO contract, voting and execution occur through Aragon.

Approved proposals execute onchain through the Aragon framework.

---

### **Snapshot Governance**

Snapshot is used for proposals that authorize actions outside of the Aragon contract treasury.

This includes:

• Ecosystem governance initiatives

• Weighted votes and prioritization decisions

• Liquidity provisioning strategies

• Authorizations executed through the governance-approved multisig Safe

Snapshot voting is offchain. Execution occurs after approval through the appropriate governance-approved wallet or operational structure.

### **BOT — Standard Dual Governance**

BOT proposals require explicit yes or no voting.

These proposals are typically used for higher-impact or structural decisions.

Under this model:

• A proposal is submitted

• xDEUS holders vote yes or no

• A quorum threshold must be met

• A majority vote determines the outcome

If quorum and approval thresholds are satisfied, the proposal executes.

---

### **OPX — Optimistic Dual Governance**

OPX proposals are initiated by the Northstar Council for time-sensitive or execution-critical actions.

Under the optimistic model:

• The proposal is submitted on-chain

• A defined time-lock period begins

• xDEUS holders may veto during this period

If no veto threshold is met within the time-lock window, the proposal executes automatically.

This model enables execution efficiency while preserving token holder oversight.

---

### **XMQ — Community Dual Governance**

XMQ proposals are initiated by eligible xDEUS holders.

This mechanism enables community-driven initiatives without requiring Northstar Council sponsorship.

Under the optimistic structure:

• A qualifying xDEUS holder submits the proposal

• A time-lock period applies

• xDEUS holders may veto during this period

If no veto threshold is met, the proposal executes automatically.

XMQ allows grassroots participation while maintaining governance safeguards.

### **BOT — Standard Dual Governance**

BOT proposals require explicit yes or no voting.

These proposals are typically used for higher-impact or structural decisions.

Under this model:

• A proposal is submitted

• xDEUS holders vote yes or no

• A quorum threshold must be met

• A majority vote determines the outcome

If quorum and approval thresholds are satisfied, the proposal executes.

### **Governance Mode Selection**

The governance mode is determined based on proposal type, urgency, and impact on treasury or protocol parameters.

All governance modes operate within the same overarching framework:

• xDEUS defines voting power

• Governance parameters may evolve through approved proposals

• All execution follows approved mandates
