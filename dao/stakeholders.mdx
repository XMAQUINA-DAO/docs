## DAO Contributors

- **DAO Members:** Community members stake DEUS tokens to earn governance rights, enabling them to actively participate in decision-making and shape the DAO’s future. The amount of influence depends on both the amount of staked tokens, and the time those tokens have been staked.
- **Northstar Council:** A unit of up to six DAO delegates responsible for supervising the DAO’s direction and long-term strategy to ensure it is aligned with the missions and constitution adopted by the DAO.
- **Scoring Committee**: A panel of industry experts, including leaders from the venture capital, robotics, and decentralized technology sectors, evaluates proposals, drafts memos, advises on developments, and offers strategic recommendations. By doing so, the committee ensures the DAO is well-informed when voting to allocate resources, ultimately helping shape promising concepts into tangible, impactful outcomes.
- **Execution Engine:** The Execution Engine constitutes one or set of operational units engaged by the DAO to manage and execute its key initiatives. The Execution Engine is entrusted with a designated budget and operates autonomously within its mandate to ensure agility and responsiveness to the DAO’s evolving priorities. Over time, the Execution Engine is expected to decentralize further, with responsibilities gradually transitioning to the broader community and automated systems as the DAO matures. DAO members with relevant expertise are encouraged to participate in the Execution Engine, contributing to its mission of driving the machine economy and advancing Physical AI initiatives.
