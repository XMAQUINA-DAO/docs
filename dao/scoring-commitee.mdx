The scoring committee is composed of industry experts, including leaders from the venture capital, robotics, and decentralized technology sectors and who are tasked with assessing proposals for Physical AI and Web3 projects.

By providing expert insights and a structured scoring process, the committee ensures that resources are allocated to the most promising projects. Their work includes drafting detailed memos prior to voting, equipping the DAO with the information needed to make well-informed decisions.

## Role of The Scoring Committee

They evaluates proposals, drafts memos, advises on developments, and offers strategic recommendations. Their main function is to analyze proposals in depth, checking for potential risks and benefits that might not be obvious at first glance. This analysis gives the broader community the details they need when casting votes on which projects should move forward.

The scoring committee does not decide anything, it provides insights and advises. Ultimately, it is the DAO members, i.e. members who are staking their DEUS that are able to vote and decide collectively.

## Evaluation Process

When a proposal comes in, the committee reviews the goals, budget, and timeline, along with any open-source components or data-sharing methods. They also consider how well each project lines up with the long-term vision of physical AI and decentralized robotics. The committee might assign a score based on a set of criteria that might include innovation, technical feasibility, and community impact. A higher score typically means the project has demonstrated a strong aligment with the mission of the MachineDAO.

## Looking Ahead

As XMAQUINA expands, the scoring committee and the community will continue to refine its evaluation methods to keep pace with new developments in AI and robotics.
