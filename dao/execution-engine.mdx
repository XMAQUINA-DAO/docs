The executing engine has a critical role within the DAO. It manages all the projects that allows the DAO to make progress and move to its next steps. The way the Execution Engine relates to the DAO is the way democracy should work : The DAO members decide, the Execution Engine executes.

Currently, the Execution Engine is composed of the original DAO founding members. But the team can be voted out and replaced by a new one.

**The Execution Engine is in charge of:**

- **Deal Sourcing:** Identifying and evaluating high-potential opportunities in robotics, DePIN, and related sectors. This involves conducting in-depth market research and sourcing investments from secondary market brokers. They have to deal with the complexity of receiving information from third parties who are willing to sell assets and presenting deals to the DAO members while respecting requirements from the third parties.
- \*\*Legal: \*\*Ensuring all operations adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and tax requirements, safeguarding the DAO’s integrity.
- **Tokenomics & Incentives:** Refining the DEUS token’s economic framework, including creating mechanisms to incentivize meaningful contributions and support long-term sustainability.
- **Governance:** Supporting the evolution of governance processes by promoting transparency, fairness, and proposing updates for community voting as the DAO grows.
- \*\*Comms & Ops: \*\*Managing day-to-day operations, coordinating workflows, driving awareness, and overseeing communication and marketing efforts to grow and engage XMAQUINA’s community while enhancing the DAO’s visibility and impact.
- \*\*Treasury & DeFi: \*\*Developing strategies to manage volatile assets, proposing DeFi strategies for treasury growth, and ensuring transparency in financial reporting to the DAO.
