title: "Governance Framework"

The vote-escrowed governance framework powered by xDEUS, including onchain treasury and multisig infrastructure.

XMAQUINA DAO operates under a vote-escrowed governance framework powered by DEUS.

Governance authority resides with xDEUS holders. Participants stake DEUS to mint non-transferable vote-escrow tokens (veTokens), aligning voting power with long-term commitment and ecosystem participation.

The governance system balances decentralization with execution efficiency. To support different asset types and operational requirements, the DAO maintains two governance-controlled treasury systems:

• Onchain treasury contracts governed via Aragon OSx

• A governance-authorized multisig infrastructure used for operational settlement and transaction execution

Both treasury systems operate under approved governance mandates. No capital deployment occurs without prior DAO approval.

Treasury wallet addresses are available via the [DAO Portal](https://dao.xmaquina.io/). All material capital movements follow approved DAO proposals, and balances and transactions can be independently verified onchain.

From TGE onward, XMAQUINA operates under a veToken-based governance model, with xDEUS governing proposal approval and veto authority.
