title: "Genesis Auctions"
---

The Genesis Auction marked the formation of XMAQUINA DAO’s capital base and governance community.

Through a series of publicly announced, on-chain auction waves, DEUS tokens were distributed directly to participants under transparent and equal terms. Each wave was open access, with pricing defined per wave and no private allocations or preferential conditions.

## **Capital Raised & Distribution**

The Genesis phase consisted of five public auction waves.

Across these auctions:

- Approximately \$10 million USD was raised
- 23.24% of total DEUS supply was distributed
- No further Genesis auctions are planned

The proceeds formed the initial DAO treasury and enabled early governance-approved humanoid robotics allocations.

## **Auction Structure**

The Genesis Auction was conducted on-chain through successive public waves.

Each wave:

- Had its own publicly disclosed pricing
- Accepted specified eligible assets
- Was open to all eligible participants

Pricing varied between waves based on timing and market conditions. However, all participants within a given wave entered under identical terms.

There were no private allocations or preferential side agreements outside of the announced wave structure.

Participants received non-transferable receipt tokens representing their future DEUS allocation. These receipt tokens enabled:

- Future DEUS claims according to vesting terms
- Early governance participation prior to token transferability

---

## **Vesting Terms**

All Genesis participants received DEUS under the same vesting schedule:

- 33% unlocked at TGE
- 67% vested linearly over 12 months

No special vesting arrangements or alternative unlock schedules were granted.

## **Role in DAO Formation**

The Genesis Auction:

- Bootstrapped the DAO treasury
- Distributed initial governance power
- Enabled early member participation
- Initiated the transition toward on-chain governance
