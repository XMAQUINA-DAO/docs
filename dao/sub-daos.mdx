XMAQUINA DAO operates through specialized SubDAOs and committees that enable focused execution while preserving decentralized governance.

Governance authority resides with DEUS token holders. SubDAOs operate under mandates approved by governance and remain accountable to the DAO.

## **What Is a SubDAO?**

A SubDAO is a mandate-driven operational unit composed of up to 6 contributors responsible for leading a defined initiative or strategic activity.

SubDAOs function as structured project teams within the DAO and operate within clearly defined governance boundaries.

Each SubDAO:

• Operates under a governance-approved mandate

• May receive a defined budget approved by DAO governance

• May utilize a dedicated multisig wallet for operational execution

• Reports transparently to the DAO

• Remains subject to oversight, modification, or dissolution by governance

All capital allocations, treasury movements, or funding authorizations must be approved by the main DAO through its governance framework. SubDAOs do not have independent authority to deploy treasury capital beyond what has been explicitly approved.

SubDAOs execute. Governance decides.
