XMAQUINA DAO is the capital allocation and governance authority of the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

It coordinates treasury deployment into humanoid robotics companies and related infrastructure through structured, onchain decision-making.

The DAO operates as a member-governed organization in which DEUS token holders direct capital allocation and strategic priorities through transparent voting mechanisms.

Within the ecosystem, the DAO:

- Deploys capital into private humanoid robotics companies and enabling infrastructure
- Governs strategic direction across treasury, protocol, and  incubation initiatives
- Oversees the Robotics Capital Markets (RCM) Protocol
- Supervises DEUS Labs and ecosystem expansion efforts
- Maintains treasury discipline and liquidity management

All material capital deployment and ecosystem-level decisions originate from DAO governance processes.

The DAO functions as the sovereign coordination layer of XMAQUINA, aligning capital formation, liquidity infrastructure, and ecosystem development under a unified governance framework.
