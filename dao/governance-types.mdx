title: "Governance Types"
---

XMAQUINA governance operates through defined proposal categories and structured approval mechanisms.

There are four proposal categories:

• **BOT** — Treasury allocations

• **XMQ** — Ecosystem initiatives

• **CDG** — Community directives

• **OPX** — Optimistic proposals

Each governance type determines how a proposal is reviewed and approved. It does not determine how a proposal originates or how it is executed following approval.

All governance actions remain subject to defined quorum requirements and voting periods.

## **1. BOT Proposals**

BOT refers to the Dual Governance model used exclusively for treasury allocations into robotics companies and related equity investments.

These proposals authorize capital deployment from the DAO treasury into external robotics positions.

BOT proposals may be voted on through either governance venue, depending on where the affected assets are held.

Approval mechanics:

• A proposal is submitted

• xDEUS holders vote yes or no

• A quorum threshold must be met

• More than 50% of participating votes must be in favor

If quorum and majority requirements are satisfied, the proposal is approved.

No robotics capital deployment occurs without approval through a BOT proposal.

## **2. XMQ Proposals**

XMQ refers to ecosystem and operational governance proposals within the DAO.

These may include:

• Liquidity provisioning

• Infrastructure and tooling upgrades

• Campaigns and ecosystem growth initiatives

• Governance parameter updates

• Operational authorizations

• Prioritization or allocation decisions

XMQ proposals follow the same quorum-based approval model as BOT proposals.

Under this structure:

• A quorum threshold must be met

Depending on proposal design, XMQ proposals may also use weighted voting.

In weighted voting formats:

• xDEUS holders may distribute their multiplier-weighted voting power across multiple options

• Total allocated voting weight cannot exceed the holder’s available governance balance

The voting format is defined at the time of submission and is visible within the governance venue.

The distinction between BOT and XMQ reflects proposal scope rather than differences in core approval mechanics.

## **3. CDG Proposals**

CDG stands for Community Dual Governance and refers to community-initiated proposals operating under the DAO’s optimistic governance framework.

Eligible xDEUS holders meeting the defined minimum voting power requirement may submit a CDG proposal.

Under this model:

• A proposal is submitted by eligible token holders

• A defined time-lock period begins

• xDEUS holders may veto during this period

• If the veto threshold is not reached, the proposal is approved

CDG enables grassroots participation while maintaining governance safeguards.

## **4. OPX Proposals**

OPX stands for Optimistic Dual Governance and operates under an optimistic framework initiated by authorized DAO units.

These are typically used for time-sensitive or mandate-driven actions requiring execution efficiency.

Under this model:

• A proposal is submitted by an authorized DAO unit

• A defined time-lock period begins

• xDEUS holders may veto during this period

• If the veto threshold is not reached, the proposal is approved

OPX enables execution efficiency while preserving token-holder oversight.

## **Governance Parameters**

Quorum thresholds, proposal thresholds, veto mechanics, and voting durations are defined by governance parameters and may evolve through future proposals. Optimistic (OPX) proposals may update certain governance parameters, subject to veto conditions.

All governance types remain subject to:

• Defined participation requirements

• Time-bound voting periods

• Onchain verifiability

No capital deployment or material governance action occurs outside of these defined governance types.
