title: "Staking Mechanics"
---

DEUS staking converts DEUS into xDEUS, enabling governance participation.

Staking and withdrawal are executed through the [Stake](https://dao.xmaquina.io/stake) interface on the DAO Portal.

Staking is non-custodial and governed by smart contracts.

---

## **Position-Based Staking**

Staking is position-based.

Each time DEUS is staked:

• A new soulbound NFT is minted

• The NFT represents that specific staked amount

• Multiplier accrual is tracked independently for that position

Example:

If a participant stakes:

• 100 DEUS → one staking position is created

• Later stakes 200 DEUS → a second staking position is created

Each position:

• Accrues multiplier independently

• Has its own staking duration

• Can be withdrawn independently

Total voting power equals the sum of all active staking positions.

---

## **Minimum Staking Requirements**

To create a staking position:

• Minimum stake per position: 100 DEUS

• Minimum lock before withdrawal request: 5 days

Both parameters are governance-configurable.

A minimum of 100 DEUS must be deposited in a single staking transaction to create a governance position.

---

## **Multiplier & Reward Accrual**

Each staking position begins with a 1x multiplier.

The multiplier increases progressively over time and reaches a maximum of 12x after 12 months of continuous staking.

Multiplier updates occur per governance epoch.

Effective weight per position:

Staked DEUS × Position Multiplier

The same multiplier governs:

• Voting power

• Quorum participation

• Reward allocation, where applicable

The multiplier caps at 12x.

---

## **Withdrawal Process**

Unstaking occurs per staking position.

To withdraw a position:

1. A withdrawal request is initiated
2. A cooldown period begins
3. After cooldown expires, the DEUS from that position becomes withdrawable

Cooldown period: 5 days

This parameter is governance-configurable.

During withdrawal:

• The position’s governance and reward multiplier is removed

• The associated soulbound NFT is burned

Other active staking positions remain unaffected.

---

## **Principal Return**

Unstaking returns the exact amount of DEUS associated with that staking position.

There is:

• No slashing

• No dilution

• No protocol-imposed loss of principal

If DEUS is restaked after withdrawal, a new staking position is created and begins again at the base 1x multiplier.
