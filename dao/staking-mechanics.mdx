title: "Staking Mechanics"
---

DEUS staking converts DEUS into xDEUS, enabling governance participation.

Staking and withdrawal are executed through the [Stake](https://dao.xmaquina.io/stake) interface on the DAO Portal.

Staking is non-custodial and governed by smart contracts.

---

## **Staking DEUS**

To participate in governance:

1. Connect your wallet to the DAO Portal.
2. Select the amount of DEUS to stake.
3. Confirm the staking transaction.

Once the transaction is confirmed:

• DEUS becomes locked in the staking contract

• xDEUS is minted to your wallet

• Governance voting power becomes active

xDEUS is non-transferable and remains tied to the staking wallet.

---

## **Voting Activation**

Voting power becomes active once DEUS is successfully staked.

Voting weight is determined by:

• The amount of DEUS staked

• The time DEUS remains staked

Voting balances update according to governance-defined epoch intervals.

---

## **Minimum Stake Duration**

DEUS must remain staked for a minimum of 5 days before a withdrawal request can be initiated.

This minimum duration supports governance stability and prevents short-term voting manipulation.

---

## **Withdrawal Request**

To withdraw staked DEUS:

1. Submit a withdrawal request through the DAO Portal.
2. A cooldown period begins.

During the cooldown period:

• xDEUS voting power is disabled

• DEUS remains locked

---

## **Cooldown Period**

A 5-day cooldown period  applies after initiating withdrawal.

Once the cooldown period ends:

• DEUS becomes available for withdrawal

• xDEUS is burned

• Governance voting rights are removed

---

## **Important Notes**

• Staked DEUS cannot be transferred while locked.

• xDEUS cannot be transferred between wallets.

• Governance rights are tied to the staking wallet.

• All staking and withdrawal actions are executed on-chain.
