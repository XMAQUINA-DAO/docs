title: "xDEUS & Voting Power"
---

Governance within XMAQUINA is powered by xDEUS, a vote-escrowed governance token minted by staking DEUS.

DEUS must be staked to participate in governance. xDEUS represents locked governance position and aligns long-term participation with decision-making influence.

---

## **What Is xDEUS**

xDEUS is a non-transferable governance token minted when DEUS is staked.

xDEUS:

• Grants voting rights across all governance types.

• Determines quorum participation

• Enables veto authority in optimistic governance models

• Represents time-weighted governance power

xDEUS is soulbound and cannot be transferred between wallets.

## **veToken Model**

XMAQUINA uses a vote-escrow model to align governance influence with long-term commitment.

Under this structure:

• DEUS is staked

• xDEUS is minted

• Governance weight increases with staking duration

This model rewards sustained participation and reduces short-term governance volatility.

Governance influence reflects both capital commitment and time commitment.

---

## **Time-Weighted Governance Model**

Effective voting power is determined by:

• The amount of DEUS staked

• The duration DEUS remains staked

Each DEUS token begins with a base multiplier of 1x voting power.

The multiplier increases progressively over time, reaching a maximum of 12x after 12 months of continuous staking.

Although multiplier updates occur per governance epoch, time progression is commonly referenced in monthly intervals for simplicity.

### **Example**

If 100 DEUS is staked:

• At staking start: 100 effective voting power

• Over time: governance weight increases gradually

• After reaching maximum duration: up to 1,200 effective voting power

The multiplier caps at 12x and does not increase further beyond that threshold.

---

## **Unstaking and  Multiplier Reset**

If DEUS is unstaked:

• xDEUS is burned

• Voting power resets

• Any future staking begins again at the base 1x multiplier

For example:

If 100 DEUS has been staked for 12 months, it may have reached the maximum 12x multiplier, resulting in:

• 1,200 effective voting power

If that stake is withdrawn:

• The 1,200 governance weight is eliminated

• xDEUS is burned

If the same 100 DEUS is later restaked:

• Voting power restarts at 100

• Multiplier accrues again over time

• Maximum weight must be rebuilt through continuous staking

This structure reinforces long-term alignment by rewarding sustained participation rather than short-term staking cycles.

---

## **Soulbound Design**

xDEUS staking positions are represented as non-transferable soulbound NFTs.

Each staking transaction mints a distinct NFT corresponding to that specific stake.

These NFTs:

• Cannot be sold

• Cannot be transferred

• Cannot be delegated outside governance logic

Governance rights remain strictly tied to the wallet that initiated the stake.

Because staking positions are soulbound:

• Governance weight cannot be traded

• Voting power cannot be transferred independently of the underlying stake

• Participation remains aligned with long-term capital commitment

## **Governance Alignment**

By requiring DEUS to be staked for governance participation, the DAO ensures:

• Long-term alignment between token holders and protocol growth

• Reduced exposure to short-term governance manipulation

• Incentivized ecosystem contribution

• Stable and accountable decision-making

All governance types, including BOT, XMQ, OPX, and CDG proposals, rely on xDEUS for voting and veto authority.
