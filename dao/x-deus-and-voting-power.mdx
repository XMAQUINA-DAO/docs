title: "xDEUS & Voting Power"
---

Governance within XMAQUINA is powered by xDEUS, a vote-escrowed governance token minted by staking DEUS.

DEUS must be staked to participate in governance. xDEUS represents locked voting power and aligns long-term participation with governance influence.

---

## **What Is xDEUS**

xDEUS is a non-transferable governance token minted when DEUS is staked.

xDEUS:

• Grants voting rights across all governance types.

• Determines quorum participation

• Enables veto authority in optimistic governance models

• Represents time-weighted governance power

xDEUS is soulbound and cannot be transferred between wallets.

## **veToken Model**

XMAQUINA uses a vote-escrow (veToken) model to align governance influence with long-term commitment.

Under this structure:

• DEUS is staked

• xDEUS is minted

• Voting power increases with staking duration

This design encourages sustained participation and reduces short-term governance volatility.

Governance influence reflects both capital commitment and time commitment.

---

## **Voting Power Calculation**

Voting power is determined by:

• The amount of DEUS staked

• The duration of time DEUS remains staked

Longer staking durations increase effective governance weight.

Voting power will adjust dynamically based on governance-defined parameters and epoch updates.

---

## **Soulbound Design**

xDEUS is non-transferable.

It cannot be:

• Sold

• Transferred

• Freely delegated outside governance logic

This ensures governance rights remain tied to participants who have staked DEUS.

---

## **Governance Alignment**

By requiring DEUS to be staked for governance participation, the DAO ensures:

• Long-term alignment between token holders and protocol growth

• Reduced exposure to short-term governance manipulation

• Incentivized ecosystem contribution

• Stable and accountable decision-making

All governance types, including BOT, XMQ, OPX, and CDG proposals, rely on xDEUS for voting and veto authority.
